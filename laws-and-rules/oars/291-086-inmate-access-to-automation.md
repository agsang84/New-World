\(1\) All requests for inmate computer equipment use shall be approved by the DOC functional unit manager or the OCE functional unit manager, depending on the area of responsibility, prior to granting access to the inmate.

\(2\) The DOC functional unit manager or the OCE functional unit manager may grant standard access. Any request for access that includes hardware or software that is purchased or donated beyond what is determined to be standard access \(special access\) shall require a recommendation from the functional unit manager requesting the access, a technical review by ISU or OCE for implementation problems, and approval by the Institutions Administrator.

\(3\) All requests for inmate access to computer equipment shall be submitted on the Inmate Access to Automation Equipment and Work Assignment Request form \(CD-1426A\). The inmate supervisor shall submit the request to the DOC functional unit manager or OCE functional unit manager for approval. If approved, the inmate supervisor and the DOC functional unit manager or OCE functional unit manager shall sign the request form, and forward it to ISU or OCE technical support for implementation. If special access is required, the Institutions Administrator shall approve and sign the request form.

\(4\) The Assistant Director for General Services/designee and the Assistant Director for Operations/designee will determine specifically what software and hardware combinations constitute DOC standard access.

\(5\) The OCE Administrator/designee and the Assistant Director for Operations/ designee will determine specifically what software and hardware combinations constitute OCE standard access.

\(6\) ISU or OCE technical support will configure a computer as specified in the Inmate Access to Automation Equipment and Work Assignment Request form.

\(a\) Login accounts will be created for the number of inmates specified in the form.

\(b\) An inmate shared folder\(s\) on the computer or network hard drive will be created. This folder\(s\) is the only authorized data storage location on the computer or network.

\(7\) No inmate shall be granted access to computer equipment or systems which contain data or are connected in any way to the DOC information system network unless the request for access has been reviewed, approved and recommended by either the DOC functional unit manager or the OCE functional unit manager and the Institutions Administrator. The Assistant Director for General Services shall determine final approval for such access.

\(8\) The inmate supervisor shall review the standards for computer use listed in OAR 291-086-0050 or 291-085-0060 with the inmate prior to allowing the inmate to use computer equipment.

\(9\) Inmate supervisors shall abide by all the department rules and standards governing inmate access to computer equipment. Inmate supervisors are responsible for all work done by inmates on computer equipment and shall:

\(a\) Perform periodic audits of software and data on the equipment to ensure appropriateness;

\(c\) Maintain contingency plans for the accidental or willful destruction of data, software, or hardware.

\(10\) The DOC functional unit manager or designee or the OCE functional unit manager or designee shall maintain a file of all approved requests for inmate access to computer equipment and proof of licenses for installed software per computer.

\(11\) As appropriate, ISU or OCE technical support will perform random reviews of the DOC or OCE computer equipment respectively to ensure the configuration conforms to the configuration on the request form. The DOC or OCE functional unit manager may contact ISU or OCE technical support to request an audit of specific computer equipment.

\(12\) Any DOC or OCE manager may suspend the authorization for an inmate to use computer equipment if violations to this rule are suspected.

\(a\) The institution assignment office will be notified of the suspension and remove the inmate from the work assignment and place him/her on “Review” status.

\(b\) Staff shall remove the computer from the work area or secure it in such a manner as to ensure that inmates will not have access to it.

\(c\) As provided in this rule, the inmate supervisor\(s\) will audit the data on the computer and may request ISU or OCE to conduct an investigation of the computer equipment by sending a formal request to ISU or OCE management. DOC requests will be through the ISU Helpdesk. OCE requests will be through OCE technical support. Findings will be reported to the functional unit manager who signed the original request form.

\(d\) If rule violations are found to have occurred, appropriate actions will be taken including, but not be limited to, disciplinary misconduct reports, program failures, and permanent restriction from any DOC inmate work or program computer system.

\(e\) As part of this process, ISU or OCE technical support may recommend to the functional unit manager a course of action to mitigate any problem which arises because of an inmate’s use of computer equipment.

\(13\) Any changes from the original Inmate Access to Automation Equipment and Work Assignment Request form, must follow the same approval process as a new request. Changes include hardware requirements, application software additions or deletions, modification to automation request purpose, and adjustments to the number of inmates using the automation equipment.
