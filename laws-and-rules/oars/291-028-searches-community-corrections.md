1. Searches of offenders may be conducted in the reasonable pursuit of correctional objectives for the purposes of officer safety, protection of the public, and reformation of the offender. 
2. An offender shall be given notice at the time of review of his/her conditions of supervision that failure to give consent to a search based upon reasonable grounds may result in arrest and/or revocation. 
3. Consent to search must be given at the time of the search by the offender or cohabitant. Neither the cohabitant nor offender may consent to search property under the exclusive control of the other.
