## 291-064-0010 Authority, Purpose and Policy

\(1\) Authority: The authority for this rule is granted to the Director of the Department of Corrections in accordance with ORS 179.040, 423.020, 423.030, 423.075 and 430.021.

\(2\) Purpose: The purpose of this rule is to establish Department of Corrections policy and procedures for the administration of psychotropic medications to inmates in Department of Corrections facilities.

\(3\) Policy: When psychotropic medications are recommended for treatment of mental disorders, the prescribing practitioner will attempt to obtain the inmate’s informed consent. In all situations involving involuntary medication, the principles of good professional practice will prevail. For involuntary medication to be approved, it must be demonstrated that the inmate has a mental disorder and as a result of that disorder there exists a likelihood of serious harm to the inmate, others or property; or the inmate is gravely disabled, and that the treatment is in the inmate’s medical interest.

\(4\) Gravely Disabled: A condition in which an inmate, as a result of a mental disorder, manifests a deterioration in routine functioning evidenced by repeated and escalating loss of cognitive or volitional control over behavior which creates a danger of serious physical and/or psychological harm to the inmate and/or serious physical injury to others.

\(5\) Guardian: A person appointed by a court of law to act as the guardian of a legally incapacitated person.

\(6\) Independent Examining Physician: A physician who shall be board certified in psychiatry, shall have been subjected to review by the Health Services Division Clinical Medical Director as to his/her qualifications to make such an examination, and shall have participated in a training program in the meaning and application of the provisions of this rule.

\(7\) Inmate: Any person under the supervision of the Department of Corrections who is not on parole or post-prison supervision status.

\(8\) Legally Incapacitated: A person who has been found by a court of law to be unable, without assistance, to properly manage or take care of their personal affairs.

\(9\) Likelihood of Serious Physical Injury: A substantial risk that an inmate will inflict serious physical injury:

\(a\) Upon the inmate, as evidenced by recent threats or attempts to commit suicide or self-inflicted physical injury; or

\(b\) Upon another, as evidenced by recent behavior which has caused such harm or has placed another person in reasonable fear of sustaining such injury; or

\(c\) Upon self or another by means of damaging property, as evidenced by recent behavior which has caused such injury or has placed another person in reasonable fear of sustaining such injury; or

\(b\) A longstanding, inflexible, pervasive, and enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of the individual’s culture \(usually constituting a maladaptive set of personality traits\), usually of little concern to the person but which causes impaired life adjustment.

\(12\) Physical Injury: Impairment of physical condition or substantial pain.

\(13\) Psychotropic Medications: The class of medications that have central nervous system activity and are commonly used for the treatment of mental disorders. Types of medications within the class of psychotropic medications include, but are not limited to, neuroleptics \(antipsychotics\), lithium, and antidepressants.
