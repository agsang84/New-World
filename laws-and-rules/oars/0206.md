(1) Active Probation Supervision: Supervision requiring the supervising officer's regular contact and monitoring to assure continued compliance with the general and special conditions of probation supervision.

(2) Compensatory Fines: A court-imposed penalty for the commission of a crime resulting in injury for which the person injured has a remedy by civil action (unless the issue of punitive damages has been previously decided on a civil case arising out of the same act and transaction). The court may award compensatory fines in addition to restitution.

(3) Compliance with the Conditions of Probation and Supervision Plan: For purposes of these rules an eligible offender shall be deemed by the supervisory authority to be in compliance with the conditions of probation and any applicable supervision plan if:

(d) All terms of any applicable supervision plan have been satisfied.

(4) Inactive Probation Supervision: A reduced level of supervision that does not include any direct supervision by a supervising officer or regular reporting; however, the offender remains subject to arrest by a supervising officer for violations of condition of supervision and return to active supervision at any time until expiration of the term of probation. All general and special conditions of supervision remain in effect with the following exceptions:

(a) General Condition #1 — Pay supervision fees (fines, restitution or other fees previously ordered by the court remain in effect); and

(b) Special conditions specifically deleted by the court.

Inactive Supervision

(1) Upon completion of the minimum period of active supervision as authorized in OAR 291-206-0015, the supervising officer or designee shall review the offender’s file and determine if the offender is in compliance with the offender’s probation conditions and any applicable supervision plan as defined in these rules.

(a) If the supervising officer or designee determines that the offender is in compliance, the supervising officer shall recommend to the supervisory authority that it place the offender on inactive probation supervision, not to exceed the supervision term imposed by the sentencing court under the rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission and applicable laws. Upon receiving a request from the supervising officer, the supervising authority shall place the offender on inactive probation supervision if the supervisory authority determines that the offender is in compliance with probation conditions and any applicable supervision plan as defined in these rules.

(b) If the supervising officer or designee determines that the offender is not in compliance with the conditions of probation and any applicable supervision plan, the supervisory authority shall extend the period of active probation supervision for the remainder of the supervision period imposed by the sentencing court under the rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission and applicable laws.

(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1)(b) of this rule, the supervising authority may later place the offender on inactive probation supervision upon request of the supervising officer if the supervisory authority determines that the offender has subsequently come into compliance with the conditions of probation and any applicable supervision plan, and that inactive probation supervision for the offender is in the best interest of the offender and the community.

Return to Active Supervision

(1) An offender remains subject to arrest for violations of conditions of supervision while on inactive probation supervision.

(2) Once an offender has been placed on inactive probation supervision, the supervisory authority may return an offender to active probation supervision for the remainder of the supervision period imposed by the sentencing court under the rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission and applicable laws, when the supervisory authority receives a report from a parole and probation officer showing good cause why inactive probation supervision is no longer in the offender's best interest or in the best interest of the community.

(3) If the supervisory authority has good cause to return an offender to active probation supervision, and the whereabouts of the offender is unknown, the supervising officer may request that the supervisory authority or the court issue a warrant for the offender’s arrest.

(4) After reviewing the report submitted under subsection (2) of this rule, the supervisory authority may return the offender to active probation supervision not to exceed the supervision term imposed by the sentencing court under the rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission and applicable laws, if the supervisory authority finds that returning the offender to active probation supervision is in the best interest of the offender and the community.

(5) When an offender is returned to active probation supervision, all general conditions and all previously imposed special conditions shall be in effect.

(6) Once returned to active probation supervision after a period of inactive probation supervision, the supervisory authority may again place the offender on inactive probation supervision upon request of the supervising officer if the supervisory authority determines that the offender has subsequently come into compliance with the conditions of probation and any applicable supervision plan, and that inactive probation supervision for the offender is in the best interest of the offender and the community.
