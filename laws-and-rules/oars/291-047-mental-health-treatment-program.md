\(8\) In order for the hearings officer to rely on the testimony of a confidential informant, information must be submitted to the hearings officer from which the hearings officer can find that the informant is a person who can be believed or that the information provided in the case at issue is truthful.

\(9\) At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearings officer will deliberate and determine whether by clear and convincing evidence that the inmate is a mentally ill person as defined in ORS 426.005 and will be administratively committed involuntarily to a state mental hospital. The hearings officer may postpone the rendering of a decision for a reasonable period of time, not to exceed three working days from the date of hearing, for the purpose of reviewing the evidence.

\(2\) Assistance by a qualified and independent person approved by the hearings officer will be ordered upon a finding that assistance is necessary based upon the inmate’s financial inability to provide an assistant, language barriers, or competence and capacity of the inmate to prepare a defense, to understand the proceedings, or to understand the rights available to him or her. An inmate subject to an administrative commitment hearing may not receive assistance from another inmate.

\(3\) The hearings officer may order an investigation on his or her own motion.

\(4\) The hearings officer shall allow the inmate access to the results of the investigation unless disclosure of the investigative results would constitute a threat to the safety and security of the facility, its staff or others, or to the orderly operation of the facility.

The reason\(s\) for exclusion shall be made part of the record.

\(4\) Notwithstanding subsection \(2\) of this rule, the hearings officer may classify documents or other evidence as confidential, and not disclose such evidence to the inmate, upon finding that disclosure of psychiatric or psychological information would constitute a danger to another individual, compromise the privacy of a confidential source, or would constitute an immediate and grave detriment to the treatment of the individual, if medically contraindicated by the treating physician or a licensed health care professional in the written account of the inmate. The reason\(s\) for classifying documents or other evidence as confidential shall be made part of the record.

The hearings officer may deny the opportunity provided in this rule upon a finding of good cause. Good cause includes, but is not limited to, an undue risk to the safety, security, or orderly operation of the facility or an immediate and grave detriment to the treatment of the individual due to disclosure of psychiatric or psychological information, if medically contraindicated by the treating physician or a licensed health care professional. The reason\(s\) for any denial of the opportunity to call witnesses or confront and cross-examine witnesses shall be made part of the record.

\(3\) If the inmate intends to call witnesses, the inmate must request that the hearings officer schedule witnesses to present testimony at the hearing. The request must be submitted to the hearings officer in writing in advance of the hearing, and include a list of the person\(s\) the inmate requests to be called to testify and direct examination questions to be posed to each person. The hearings officer shall arrange for the taking of testimony from such witnesses as properly requested by the inmate, subject to the exclusions and restrictions provided in these rules. The hearings officer, rather than the inmate, shall pose questions submitted by the inmate, including questions on cross-examination, if any. The hearings officer may briefly recess the hearing to allow the inmate, the inmate’s assistant, or both, an opportunity to prepare cross-examination questions.

\(4\) The hearings officer may limit testimony when it is cumulative or irrelevant.

\(5\) All questions which may assist in the resolution of the proceedings, as determined by the hearings officer, shall be posed. The reason\(s\) for not posing a question will be made part of the record.

\(6\) The hearings officer may, on his or her own motion, call witnesses to testify.

\(7\) The hearings officer may exclude a specific inmate or staff witness upon finding that the witness’ testimony would not assist in the resolution of the proceeding or presents an immediate undue hazard to facility security. If a witness is excluded, the reason\(s\) shall be made part of the record.

\(8\) The hearings officer may exclude other persons as witnesses, after giving reasonable consideration to alternatives available for obtaining witness testimony, upon finding that the witness’ testimony would not assist the hearings officer in the resolution of the proceeding, the witness’ appearance at the hearing would present an undue risk to the safety, security, or orderly operation of the facility or the safety of the witness or others, or that the witness is not reasonably available. The reason\(s\) for exclusion shall be made part of the record.

\(9\) Persons other than staff requested as witnesses may refuse to appear or testify.

The hearing record shall be processed with final action subject to review by the Superintendent/designee of the Oregon State Hospital. The findings must be on the merits. Technical or clerical errors in the writing or processing of the transfer request, or both, shall not be grounds for a no justification finding, unless there is substantial prejudice to the inmate.

\(2\) Justification: The hearings officer may find the evidence supports the inmate’s placement in a state mental hospital listed in ORS 426.010 or a hospital or facility designated by the Department of Human Services, in which case the hearings officer will so inform the inmate and recommend that the inmate’s administrative commitment exceed 30 days. The hearing record shall be processed with final action subject to review by the Superintendent/designee of the Oregon State Hospital.
