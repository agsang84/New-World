\(1\) Case plan compliance is defined as acceptable participation in work and self-improvement programs required within the case plan. The required activities within the case plan are determined by ongoing assessment and evaluation, which begins at the inception of the inmate prison term.

\(a\) An inmate will be considered to be compliant if he/she was not failed from the required program activity during the review period under consideration, nor did the inmate refuse to participate in required programming during the review period under consideration.

\(b\) As needed, the counselor or multi-disciplinary team will evaluate an inmate’s compliance with the required program activity.

\(c\) If the inmate’s counselor or multi-disciplinary team determines the inmate is non-compliant with the case plan, he/she will approve a program failure for documentation in the inmate’s computer record.

\(2\) Institution conduct compliance is defined as maintaining Level I or Level II major misconduct-free behavior during the review period. Major misconduct is documented in accordance with the department's rules on Prohibited Inmate Conduct and Processing Disciplinary Actions \(OAR 291-105\). Any finding of a Level I or Level II major misconduct violation during the review period will be considered as noncompliance. The date of the adjudication, not of the incident, will be used for the date of the violation.

\(3\) At the end of each review period, the OISC staff will review the inmate’s computer records for information reflecting the inmate's compliance with the current case plan and institution conduct. Based on the information contained in the inmate’s computer records, the OISC staff will apply either:

\(a\) An effective 0, 10, or 20 percent reduction to the sentencing guidelines sentence proportional for the review period under consideration for sentences eligible for a maximum of 20% earned time, or

\(b\) An effective 0, 15, or 30 percent reduction to the sentencing guidelines sentence proportional for the review period under consideration for sentences eligible for a maximum of 30% earned time.

\(4\) For inmates housed in non-Oregon Department of Corrections facilities, the staff, as designated by the Offender Management and Rehabilitation Division will review the inmate’s institution file including any reports received from the housing facility to determine compliance with the current case plan and institution conduct.

\(a\) Case plan compliance will be determined by the inmate's reported compliance with requirements as determined by Department staff or the housing facility staff.

\(b\) Due process comparable to the department's rules on Prohibited Inmate Conduct and Processing Disciplinary Actions \(OAR 291-105\) shall be applied. Institution conduct non-compliance will be determined by substituting the rule of prohibited conduct, for the rule violated at the housing facility, with the most equivalent charges as defined in the department's rules on Prohibited Inmate Conduct and Processing Disciplinary Actions \(OAR 291-105\). The functional unit manager or designee may impose sanctions, in addition to that imposed by the housing facility, related to sentence reductions.

\(5\) For each review period under consideration for inmates housed in Department of Corrections facilities, the OISC staff will list the reasons for applying or not applying earned time credits and record the corresponding percentage of earned time applied to the inmate’s sentence on the Earned Time Computation Form \(CD 1154D\).

\(6\) For inmates housed in non-Oregon Department of Corrections facilities, the staff, as designated by the Offender Management and Rehabilitation Division, will list the reasons for applying or not applying earned time credits and record the corresponding percentage of earned time applied on the Earned Time Computation Form \(CD 1154D\).

\(7\) Upon the application of earned time credits toward an inmate’s sentence for the review period under consideration, the OISC Unit will re-compute the inmate's new earned time release date, file the Earned Time Computation Form \(CD 1154D\) in the institution file, and provide a copy of the determination to the inmate.

\(8\) Determination of Earned Time Credits During Presentence Incarceration: For crimes committed on or after November 1, 1989, earned time credits will be computed for the period in which an inmate is in custody in a non-Department of Corrections facility prior to sentencing and admission to the Department of Corrections, based solely on the inmate's conduct in the facility.

\(a\) Conduct compliance will be assumed, unless the Department receives documentation of adjudicated misconduct from the facility.

\(A\) For sentences eligible for a maximum of 20% earned time credits, the inmate will be granted an effective 0 or 20 percent reduction toward the sentencing guidelines sentence proportional for the length of presentence incarceration.

\(B\) For sentences eligible for a maximum of 30% earned time credits, the inmate will be granted an effective 0 or 30 percent reduction toward the sentencing guidelines sentence proportional for the length of presentence incarceration.

\(b\) Any verified major misconduct equivalent to a Level I or Level II major misconduct violation as defined in the department’s rules on Prohibited Inmate Conduct and Processing Disciplinary Actions \(OAR 291-105\) during any of the presentence incarceration credits applied to the sentence will result in an effective 0 percent reduction toward the sentencing guidelines sentence proportional for the total length of presentence incarceration. The date of the adjudication, not of the incident, will be used for the date of the violation.

\(9\) If the inmate escapes, the OISC staff will close out the current earned time review period, changing the current review period to end the day after escape. An inmate that is returned from an escape to a Department of Corrections facility will have the starting date of the new earned time credit cycle begin with the date of return. The escape will constitute a program failure for the period up to the escape.

\(10\) Alternative Incarceration Program:

\(a\) If, during any review period, the inmate is assigned to an Alternative Incarceration Program, the inmate will be considered as participating in the case plan. If the inmate, for sufficient justification as determined by the functional unit manager’s committee, is unsuccessful and fails to complete any portion of the program or requests to be voluntarily removed, the inmate will be considered noncompliant with the case plan and receive a program failure during that review period.

\(b\) If the inmate fails to successfully complete the non-prison leave granted through the Alternative Incarceration Program, the inmate will be considered a program failure and non-compliant with institution conduct for the length of the inmate’s non-prison leave. The failure to successfully complete the non-prison leave will not result in a retraction of the portion of earned time credits for program compliance advanced at the beginning of the final review period as outlined in OAR 291-097-0250\(2\).

\(11\) Determination of earned time credits for inmates on short-term transitional leave:

\(a\) Earned time credits will be computed for the period in which an inmate is serving the remainder of his/her sentencing guidelines term of incarceration on short-term transitional leave \(OAR 291-063\).

\(A\) Institution conduct and case plan compliance will be assumed while an inmate is released on short-term transitional leave.

\(B\) Earned time credits for the period on transitional leave will be applied at a rate of 20 percent or 30 percent, in accordance with the applicable rate for the sentence at the time of release onto short-term transitional leave.

\(b\) A revocation of an inmate’s short-term transitional leave is deemed non-compliance with the inmate’s case plan and non-compliance with institution conduct. Upon revocation of short-term transitional leave, an inmate will receive an effective 0 percent reduction for case plan compliance and 0 percent reduction toward the sentencing guidelines sentence for institutional conduct proportional for the length of the inmate’s short-term transitional leave.

\(c\) The failure to successfully complete the short-term transitional leave will not result in a retraction of the portion of earned time credits for program compliance advanced at the beginning of the final review period as outlined in OAR 291-097-0250\(2\).

\(12\) If all of an inmate's sentence\(s\) is vacated, reversed and remanded for new trial, or conviction affirmed and remanded for resentencing, the OISC staff will close out the current earned time review period to end the day after release to the sentencing court. An inmate that is returned on a resentence will start a new review period, effective the date of return to a Department of Corrections facility. The new earned time credit cycle date will be reflected on the inmate's facesheet.

\(13\) Determination of earned time credits for inmates serving the remainder of a sentencing guidelines sentence on conditional release \(Second Look\):

\(a\) Earned time credits will be computed for the period in which an inmate is serving the remainder of his/her sentencing guidelines term of incarceration in the community on conditional release, based solely on the inmate’s compliance with his/her conditional release plan.

\(b\) Earned time credits for the period on conditional release \(Second Look\) will be applied at a rate of 20 percent or 30 percent, in accordance with the applicable rate for the sentence at the time of release onto conditional release \(Second Look\).

\(c\) Conduct compliance will be assumed unless the inmate’s conditional release is revoked by the sentencing court.

\(d\) Any suspension or revocation of an inmate’s conditional release prior to the inmate reaching his/her projected earned time date will result in an effective 0 percent reduction in the sentencing guidelines prison term for the length of the inmate’s sentence being served in the community on conditional release.

\(14\) If an inmate is incarcerated in an Oregon county jail prior to the inmate’s return to a Department of Corrections facility following an escape, suspension or revocation of second look conditional release, or violation of short-term transitional leave or non-prison leave, earned time credits will be computed for the period in which the inmate is in custody based solely on the inmate’s conduct in the county jail.

\(a\) Conduct compliance will be assumed, unless the Department receives documentation of adjudicated misconduct from the facility.

\(A\) For sentences eligible for a maximum of 20% earned time credits, the inmate will be granted an effective 0 or 20 percent reduction toward the sentencing guidelines sentence proportional for the length of incarceration.

\(B\) For sentences eligible for a maximum of 30% earned time credits, the inmate will be granted an effective 0 or 30 percent reduction toward the sentencing guidelines sentence proportional for the length of incarceration.

\(b\) Any verified major misconduct equivalent to a Level I or Level II major misconduct violation as defined in the Department’s rule on Prohibited Inmate Conduct and Processing Disciplinary Actions \(OAR 291-105\) during the incarceration will result in an effective 0 percent reduction toward the sentencing guidelines sentence proportional for the length of incarceration. The date of the adjudication, not of the incident, will be used for the date of the violation.

\(15\) Work Release: A revocation of an inmate’s work release is deemed noncompliant with the inmate’s case plan.

\(1\) Pursuant to ORS 421.121 and this rule, consideration for earned time credit may also be given for crimes committed prior to July 1, 2015 for an inmate who obtains a high school diploma, General Educational Development \(GED\) certificate, a certificate or degree from a post-secondary education institution as defined in ORS 337.511, or a journey level certification from a registered apprenticeship program as defined in ORS 660.010, on or after January 1, 2010.

\(2\) Determination of Earned Time Credits for Education or Apprenticeship Certifications:

\(a\) Inmates who obtain a high school diploma, General Educational Development \(GED\) certificate, a certificate or degree from a post-secondary education institution as defined in ORS 337.511, or a journey level certification from a registered apprenticeship program as defined in ORS 660.010 prior to January 1, 2010 or whose crime was committed on or after July 1, 2015 are not eligible to be considered for earned time credits for education or apprenticeship certifications.

\(b\) Subject to OAR 291-097-0250 \(Retraction of Earned Time Credits\), 291-097-0255 \(Restoration of Earned Time Credits\), and 291-097-0260 \(Determination of Earned Time Credits During Final Review Period for Sentencing Guidelines Sentences\), at the time an inmate obtains a high school diploma, General Educational Development \(GED\) certificate, a certificate or degree from a post-secondary education institution as defined in ORS 337.511, or a journey level certification from a registered apprenticeship program as defined in ORS 660.010 on or after January 1, 2010 and whose crime was committed prior to Julu 1, 2015, the OISC staff will apply the amount of earned time credits, not to exceed 60 days, to the amount of earned time credits actually received by the inmate for either maintaining appropriate institution conduct or compliance with his/her case plan, in order to bring the inmate’s total earned time credits up to the amount of earned time credits the inmate would have received if the inmate maintained appropriate institution conduct and was in full compliance with his/her case plan as of the date the inmate obtained the education or apprenticeship certification.

\(A\) The department may apply up to 60 days earned time credits for education or apprenticeship certifications toward prior earned time not credited to the sentence due to adjudicated misconduct during the presentence incarceration or while an inmate is incarcerated in an Oregon county jail prior to the inmate’s return to a Department of Corrections facility following an escape, revocation of second look conditional release, or violation of short-term transitional leave or non-prison leave, or toward non-compliance with institutional conduct or the case plan, and toward earned time previously retracted during the service of the sentence.

\(B\) In no event will an inmate be credited with more earned time credits than the amount of earned time credits the inmate would have received toward the sentence if the inmate maintained appropriate institutional behavior and was in full compliance with his/her case plan as of the date the inmate obtained a high school diploma, General Educational Development \(GED\) certificate, a certificate or degree from a post-secondary education institution as defined in ORS 337.511, or a journey level certification from a registered apprenticeship program as defined in 660.010.

\(C\) The earned time credits for education or apprenticeship certifications may not be applied to a sentence whose prison term reached its earned time release date prior to the date the inmate obtained a high school diploma, General Educational Development \(GED\) certificate, a certificate or degree from a post-secondary education institution as defined in ORS 337.511, or a journey level certification from a registered apprenticeship program as defined in 660.010.

\(D\) An inmate may be credited with multiple education or apprenticeship certifications as long as no individual sentence receives more than 60 days total earned time credit for obtaining a high school diploma, General Educational Development \(GED\) certificate, a certificate or degree from a post-secondary education institution as defined in ORS 337.511, or a journey level certification from a registered apprenticeship program as defined in 660.010.

\(1\) Four months prior to an inmate’s projected release date, OISC staff \(or the ODOC staff, as designated by the Offender Management and Rehabilitation Division, for inmates housed in non-Oregon Department of Corrections facilities\) will conduct a final review of inmates’ earned time compliance.

\(a\) Final reviews will be conducted only for inmates serving a sentencing guidelines sentence. OISC staff will advance and apply earned time credits for the final review period.

\(b\) An inmate’s full compliance with the case plan and institutional behavior will be assumed during the final review period.

\(A\) For inmates sentenced on or after November 1, 1989, with sentences eligible for a maximum of 20 percent earned time credits, the OISC staff will apply an effective 20 percent reduction in sentence for the final review period and the OISC Unit will re-compute the inmate’s new earned time release date.

\(B\) For inmates sentenced on or after November 1, 1989 with sentences eligible for a maximum of 30 percent earned time credits, the OISC staff will apply an effective 30 percent reduction in sentence for the final review period and the OISC Unit will re-compute the inmate’s new earned time release date.

\(2\) If, after the completion of a final review and advancement of earned time credits for the final review period, the inmate’s prison term is extended as a result of a new sentence or an adjustment in presentence time, the OISC staff will delete the final review and any earned time credits advanced for the final review period. The OISC staff will complete a new Earned Time Computation form \(CD 1154D\) to assure that the extended prison term is reviewed in accordance with these rules.

\(3\) If, after the completion of a final review and advancement of earned time credits for the final review period, the inmate’s prison term is reduced, the OISC Unit will adjust the final review period and any earned time credits advanced for the final review period provided the inmate was in full compliance with his/her case plan and institutional behavior at the time of the final review.

\(a\) If the inmate was in partial compliance with his/her case plan or institutional behavior at the time of the final review, the OISC staff will delete the final review and any earned time credits advanced for the final review period.

\(b\) The OISC staff will complete a new Earned Time Computation form \(CD 1154D\) to assure that the reduced prison term is reviewed in accordance with these rules.

\(4\) If, after the completion of a final review and advancement of earned time credits for the final review period, the inmate obtains a high school diploma, General Educational Development \(GED\) certificate, a certificate or degree from a post-secondary education institution as defined in ORS 337.511, or a journey level certification from a registered apprenticeship program as defined in ORS 660.010 on or after January 1, 2010 and whose crime was committed prior to July 1, 2015, the OISC Unit will adjust the final review period and any earned time credits advanced for the final review period in accordance with OAR 291-097.

\(1\) The functional unit manager may recommend to the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision that an inmate receive prison term reduction credits in those cases where the inmate has received a parole release date set from the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision of 36 months or more, if:

\(a\) The inmate has applied for a reduction and the period under review falls within the established prison term;

\(b\) The inmate has completed a three-year period of good conduct; and

\(c\) The inmate has complied with case plan efforts to address problems associated with the inmate's criminal conduct present at the time of incarceration.

\(d\) Notwithstanding \(b\) and \(c\) above, the functional unit manager may consider significant improvement in inmate behavior and case plan efforts during the last 12 months of the three-year period and recommend that the parole release date be reset.

\(2\) Three-Year Period of Good Conduct: For purposes of these rules, an inmate shall be considered to have maintained a three-year period of good conduct if:

\(a\) The inmate has not received any Level I — II rule violations as defined in the Department's rule on Prohibited Inmate Conduct and Processing Disciplinary Actions \(OAR 291-105\) during the three years under review.

\(b\) Notwithstanding \(a\) above, upon finding that an inmate has committed a Level III or IV rule violation as defined in the Department's rule on Prohibited Inmate Conduct and Processing Disciplinary Actions \(OAR 291-105\), after a formal disciplinary hearing or upon waiver of the inmate's right to hearing, the hearings officer may recommend to the functional unit manager that the inmate not be considered for a positive recommendation for prison term reduction within a three-year period from the date of the rule violation.

\(3\) Demonstrable Achievement in Addressing Problems Associated with the Inmate's Criminal Conduct Present at the Time of Incarceration: For purposes of these rules, an inmate shall be considered to have made demonstrable achievement in addressing problems associated with the inmate's criminal conduct present at the time of incarceration if the inmate has received favorable reports for his/her successful participation in one or more self-improvement programs appropriate to his/her need as determined by departmental assessment captured in the case plan \(to the extent these specific programs are available to the inmate\). An inmate will be considered to be successfully participating in a self-improvement program if he/she is documented to be registered on a waiting list for the program within 30 days of the development of the case plan.

\(4\) Inmates serving a term of incarceration in a Department of Corrections facility as a sanction for violation of parole or post-prison supervision are ineligible for consideration for a positive recommendation.

\(a\) Inmates sentenced for aggravated murder or as dangerous offenders, and those whose parole the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision denied are not subject to personal reviews.

\(1\) The functional unit manager may recommend to the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision that an inmate's parole release date be reset to an earlier date in those cases where the inmate has received a parole release date set from the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision of 36 months or less, if:

\(a\) The inmate has been incarcerated in a Department of Corrections facility for at least six months; and

\(b\) The inmate's performance in two areas, the case plan and institution conduct, as set forth in the criteria for calculation and application of earned time credits in OAR 291-097 0020 warrants a positive recommendation.

\(2\) Inmates serving a term of incarceration in a Department of Corrections facility as a sanction for violation of parole or post-prison supervision are ineligible for consideration for a positive recommendation.

\(3\) Inmates sentenced to a minimum term of incarceration pursuant to ORS 144.110 \(judicial minimum\) or 161.610 \(gun minimum\), are ineligible for consideration for a positive recommendation, until such minimum incarceration term has been served.

\(4\) Inmates serving an enhanced sentence pursuant to ORS 161.725 and 161.735 \(dangerous offender\), or pursuant to 426.725 \(sexually dangerous offender\), are ineligible for consideration for a positive recommendation.

\(5\) At the end of the review period, based upon six-months increments beginning with the inmate’s admission date, a counselor will evaluate the inmate's eligibility, consistent with OAR 291-097-0020\(3\), for a positive recommendation based on the criteria set forth above. Based upon the inmate's performance, the counselor will recommend to the functional unit manager or designee that the inmate be considered by the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision for a 0, 10 or 20 percent reduction in the prison term set by the Board, and a corresponding parole release date.

\(6\) The functional unit manager or designee will review the recommendation of the counselor, approve/deny or otherwise modify the recommendation, and send the determination to the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision on an action sheet for the Board's consideration.

The Department of Corrections may recommend to the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision that an inmate's parole release date be reset to a later date as a result of a disciplinary action, as follows:

\(1\) The inmate is found guilty of a major rule violation after a formal disciplinary hearing or upon waiver of the inmate's right to a hearing, and the final disciplinary order directs that the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision be notified that the department recommends that the inmate's parole release date be extended in accordance with the department's rule on Prohibited Inmate Conduct and Processing Disciplinary Actions \(OAR 291-105\).

\(2\) In order to qualify the inmate for a parole release date extension recommendation, the rule violation must involve misconduct that can be classified within one of four categories as follows:

\(a\) Hazard to human life/health;

\(b\) Hazard to security;

\(c\) Hazard to property;

\(d\) Third in series of rule violations within a three-month period while assigned to any Department of Corrections facility or program.

\(3\) A parole release date extension shall not be recommended without consideration of the following:

\(a\) Effectiveness of the sanction as a disciplinary measure, both to the inmate and to the general inmate population;

\(b\) Degree of hazard posed by the misconduct to human health and/or life, facility security, or to property;

\(c\) Seriousness of the misconduct had it been committed in the wider community;

\(d\) Circumstances of the misconduct; and

\(e\) The inmate's prior record of institution conduct.

\(4\) A recommendation for extension of an inmate's parole release date shall be within the range corresponding to the violation classification category, as set forth in Table 3.

\(5\) A parole release date extension recommendation will not be made that, if followed by the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision, will result in a parole release date beyond the inmate’s statutory good time date.

\(6\) If an inmate is found guilty of a major rule violation, before a parole release date has been set, that qualifies the inmate for a parole release date extension recommendation in accordance with these rules, the department will recommend to the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision that the inmate's parole release date be adjusted when set to reflect the department's recommended extension, if any.

\(1\) An inmate may obtain an independent review of the determination of his/her referral to the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision for a modification of the parole release date set by writing to the Counselor Case Management Unit and requesting an administrative review of the determination.

\(a\) The review request must be in writing on an inmate communication form \(CD 214\) and must state the reason\(s\) why the inmate believes the functional unit manager's or designee's decision not to refer the request to the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision is not correct.

\(b\) Requests for administrative review must be received by the Counselor Case Management Unit no later than 30 days after the date of the determination.

\(2\) If an inmate submits a proper and timely request for administrative review, the Counselor Case Management Unit shall review the determination and either approve or modify the determination in writing to the inmate and functional unit manager within 30 days after the receipt of the request for administrative review.
