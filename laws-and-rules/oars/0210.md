Identification, Assessment, Review, and Management of Inmates who Identify as Transgender or Intersex at Intake

(1) Identification at Intake: Staff shall seek to identify inmates who present or identify as transgender or intersex upon delivery to the Department of Corrections during intake processing, based on available information from the county, the inmate (including the inmate’s stated gender identity, if any), and as developed by staff.

(2) Appropriate and Professional Questioning:

(a) Staff shall interview inmates regarding their sex and gender identity only when necessary to develop information for making appropriate intake and housing assignments, classification assignments, programming assignments; to provide health care and health assessments; and as necessary for the inmate's health or safety, or for the safe, secure, and orderly operation of the facility.

(b) Staff shall interview inmates in a private and professional manner to avoid subjecting the inmate to the risk of possible abuse or ridicule.

(c) Designated staff shall submit information to the Transgender and Intersex Committee for review and determination of appropriate housing placement.

(3) Initial Placement in Holding Cell: When staff identify an inmate who presents or identifies as transgender or intersex during intake processing, staff shall place the inmate in a holding cell with no other inmates present to provide for the inmate's safety and to provide the inmate with a measure of privacy pending further review.

(4) Unclothed Searches:

(a) Unclothed searches are performed by appropriate security staff on each inmate upon the inmate's delivery to the facility. Ordinarily, a security staff member of the same gender as the inmate will be assigned to conduct the unclothed search.

(b) When an inmate identifies or presents as transgender or intersex during intake, staff shall ask the inmate to identify whether they prefer that male or female staff conduct the unclothed search.

(c) If an inmate who has not previously been identified as transgender or intersex during intake processing later identifies or presents as transgender or intersex during the conduct of an unclothed search, staff will immediately cease conducting the search and ask the inmate the gender of security staff they prefer to conduct the unclothed search. Staff will accommodate the inmate’s stated preference.

(5) Intake Housing Assignment:

(a) Following initial placement in a holding cell, an inmate who identifies as transgender or intersex during intake processing shall be assigned to a single cell in the Infirmary, on a space available basis, until the appropriate housing for the inmate has been staffed by the Transgender and Intersex Committee.

(b) If there are no infirmary beds available, the functional unit manager or designee will assign the inmate to appropriate alternative housing in the facility, and document the reasons for the alternative housing assignment.

(6) Clothing at Intake Center: Inmates who identify as transgender or intersex at intake will be issued the following clothing to wear during intake processing — two sets of scrubs; two t-shirts; sweatshirt; two bras (if requested or needed); underwear (type issued based on inmate request); pajamas (type issued based on inmate request); and socks and intake shoes.

(7) Recreation at Intake Center: Inmates who identify as transgender or intersex at intake will be afforded the opportunity for out of cell time on the same basis as other inmates assigned to the unit they are being housed in or as facility operation allows. A minimum out of cell time for all inmates will be three times a week or as staff availability and circumstances allow.

(8) Shower and Hygiene at Intake Center: Inmates who identify as transgender or intersex at intake shall be given the opportunity to shower privately from other inmates.
