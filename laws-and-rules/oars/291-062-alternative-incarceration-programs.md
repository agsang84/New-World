\(3\) Other Charges: Any criminal or civil accusatory instrument that alleges wrong doing and for which a person may be imprisoned or incarcerated.

\(4\) Short-Term Transitional Leave: A period of leave not to exceed 90 days preceding an established release date designed to provide inmates with transitional opportunities that promote successful reintegration into the community. Short-term transitional leave is granted in accordance with ORS 421.158.

\(5\) Nonprison Leave: A period of leave not to exceed 90 days preceding an established release date granted to inmates successfully completing the institution phase of an alternative incarceration program \(AIP\). Nonprison leave is designed to provide inmates with transitional opportunities that promote successful reintegration into the community and is granted in accordance with ORS 137.750, 137.751, 421.508, and 421.510, and the department’s rules on Alternative Incarceration Programs \(OAR 291-062\).

\(1\) The Department of Corrections has established and operates alternative incarceration programs.

\(a\) Alternative incarceration programs encompass intensive cognitive programming, intensive addictions treatment, or a combination of the two.

\(b\) Each alternative incarceration program is a minimum of 270 days in duration and includes two components — a structured institution program and a period of structured nonprison leave.

\(c\) Each alternative incarceration program requires its participants to engage in a minimum of 14 hours per day of highly structured routine, seven days per week for the duration of the program.

\(2\) Inmates are required to participate in and successfully complete transition classes offered as a condition of program graduation. The number and frequency of these classes will be determined by each facility.

\(3\) The department in its discretion may grant nonprison leave to inmates who successfully complete the institution phase of an alternative incarceration program if:

\(a\) The inmate’s sentencing judgment authorizes a release to post-prison supervision in accordance with ORS 421.508, 137.750, and 137.751; and

\(b\) The inmate has identified viable self-support options in the community: or

\(c\) The supervising community corrections agency has approved a temporary subsidy, such as treatment transition funds, that will assist the inmate with successful community transition.

\(d\) All expenses not otherwise approved by the supervising community corrections agency must be covered by the inmate.

\(4\) For those whose crimes were committed prior to January 1, 2009, transitional leave for alternative incarceration programs was authorized under ORS 421.128. For the purposes of these rules, the operational aspects, processes, and any subsequent violation sanctions are the same as and subject to rules referencing nonprison leave.

\(1\) The functional unit manager or designee in his/her discretion may remove or suspend an inmate from any portion of an alternative incarceration program, and may reassign the inmate to another Department of Corrections facility to serve the balance of the inmate's court-imposed incarceration term, for administrative or disciplinary reasons. The decision to remove or suspend an inmate from the program will be made in consultation with a committee appointed by the functional unit manager or designee that is responsible to review the performance of inmates participating in an alternative incarceration program.

\(2\) Administrative Removal/Suspension:

\(a\) The functional unit manager or designee in his/her discretion may immediately remove or suspend an inmate from the program and reassign the inmate to another Department of Corrections facility without a hearing, for administrative reasons.

\(b\) An inmate who is not available to participate substantially in the program \(e.g., physical and mental illness, court appearance\(s\), disciplinary segregation, etc.\) for up to 30 days following placement will be suspended from participation and will be evaluated by the committee to determine whether the inmate will be removed from the program or accepted back into the program at the program level deemed appropriate by the functional unit manager or designee.

\(c\) Any change in status that would cause an inmate to be ineligible to continue participating in the program as described in OAR 291-062-0130 \(e.g., discovery of a detainer\), may result in a suspension.

\(A\) If suspended, the inmate will have 30 days to resolve eligibility status with the department. If the inmate’s eligibility status remains unresolved, the inmate will be removed from the program.

\(B\) An extension may be made by the functional unit manager or designee on a case-by-case basis.

\(d\) If other charges will result in immediate incarceration upon release to nonprison leave, the inmate will have 30 days to resolve eligibility status with the department. If the inmate’s eligibility status remains unresolved, the inmate will be removed from the program. An extension may be made by the functional unit manager or designee on a case-by-case basis.

\(e\) Inmates are expected to participate in all aspects of their program assignment at a level consistent with the length of time they have been assigned to the program.

\(A\) The functional unit manager or designee in his/her discretion may suspend an inmate from the program for 30 days or more when, in consultation with the program performance review committee, the functional unit manager or designee determines that the inmate is not making adequate program progress. During the suspension, the inmate will be given an opportunity to come into compliance with established program standards.

\(B\) If the inmate comes into compliance, the inmate will be placed at a program level deemed appropriate by the functional unit manager or designee. The inmate may be removed from the program for failure to meet program expectations. If the inmate is assigned to an intensive alternative incarceration addictions program, the inmate may have the length of the program extended beyond 270 days.

\(3\) Disciplinary Removal/Suspension: An inmate who after a hearing in accordance with procedures provided in the department's rules on Prohibited Inmate Conduct and Processing Disciplinary Actions \(OAR 291-105\) is found to have committed a major disciplinary rule violation may be removed from the program and transferred to another Department of Corrections facility at the discretion of the functional unit manager or designee.

\(4\) Voluntary Removal: An inmate may elect to be removed from an alternative incarceration program; however, to do so the inmate must sign a document requesting removal from the program to the functional unit manager or designee. Voluntary removal from the program constitutes a program failure.

\(5\) An inmate who fails an alternative incarceration program will be ineligible to participate in any other non-AIP intensive treatment program during the same admission cycle \(this does not include dual diagnosis programs\).

\(6\) Administrative Review of Removal for Program Failure:

\(a\) When the functional unit manager or designee removes an inmate from the inmate’s program assignment for a program failure, the inmate will be notified in writing of the reason for the removal decision, and given the opportunity for administrative review of the decision.

\(b\) To obtain an administrative review of the removal decision, an inmate must send a request for administrative review in writing to the Assistant Director for Offender Management and Rehabilitation or designee, together with any supporting documentation. The Assistant Director for Offender Management and Rehabilitation or designee must receive the request within 20 business days of the date of the notice of the administrative removal.

\(c\) The review should be completed within 20 business days after receiving an inmate's review request. The Assistant Director for Offender Management and Rehabilitation or designee’s decision on administrative review shall be final.

Upon apprehension, it shall be the responsibility of the supervising officer to report the alleged violation and recommended sanction in writing to the institution functional unit manager or designee.

\(B\) If the inmate’s whereabouts are known and the violation is believed to support a revocation of the nonprison leave, it shall be the responsibility of the supervising officer to report the alleged violation in writing to the institution functional unit manager or designee within five working days of the alleged violation.

\(b\) When revocation of nonprison leave is approved, the releasing authority shall ensure that a misconduct report is submitted in accordance with the department’s rules on Prohibited Inmate Conduct and Processing Disciplinary Actions \(OAR 291-105\).
