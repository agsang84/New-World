The counselor is responsible for ensuring the transfer is consistent with the inmate’s case plan, and transfers have been approved by the appropriate stakeholders. Stakeholder approval must be reflected in the 1206 transfer request. 
3. While the department recognizes the importance of family and friends in the rehabilitation of inmates, the department is unable to grant transfer requests for the purpose of hardship or convenience.
