## 291-013-0065 - General Provisions — Use of Force

1. Employees are authorized to apply physical force when and to the degree that it reasonably appears necessary. Use of force will be authorized to maintain legitimate correctional objectives:  \(a\) For self defense or defend another person against an inmate by using reasonable force;  \(b\) To prevent the escape of an inmate from secure custody;  \(c\) To prevent the escape of an inmate during transportation;  \(d\) To prevent or stop the serious destruction of property;  \(e\) To quell a disturbance;  \(f\) To overcome an inmate’s physical resistance to a valid order; or  \(g\) To prevent an inmate from injuring or killing himself/herself or other persons. 
2. Physical force shall be employed when it reasonably appears that other alternatives are not feasible to the situation. When the use of force is justified, only the amount and type of force that reasonably appears necessary to accomplish the authorized objective shall be used. Force shall be de-escalated or terminated as soon as possible consistent with resuming and maintaining control of the situation.  \(a\) An employee shall consider all types and amounts of force available and begin with the lowest type and amount that is reasonable given the specifics of the situation.  \(b\) Non-force alternatives, such as talking an inmate into compliance, giving a warning, verbal command or demonstrating a show of force, should be used before actual physical force, if time and circumstances permit.  \(c\) Immediate use of physical force is authorized in circumstances in which warnings and other non-force alternatives, such as talking an inmate into compliance, are not reasonable or available to the employee.  \(d\) Employees may use physical force, to include control and compliance holds and hand-to-hand physical techniques, to restrict, immobilize, and attain control of the resisting inmate.  \(e\) Both the carotid hold and choke hold are prohibited except in self-defense or defense of another where there is no reasonable alternative and where the situation is a clear and immediate threat to life.
3. Prior to the use of force when time and circumstances permit, the employee will warn the inmate that force will be used if he/she does not immediately comply with staff orders. 
4. An employee will exercise caution before the use of force, if time and circumstances permit, by performing the following:  \(a\) Evaluate the situation for the elements of risk;  \(b\) Report the situation to master control or a supervisor; and  \(c\) Work with a backup employee, preferably with the direct observation of a supervisor. 
5. Use of force and subsequent restraints shall be used only for restraint and not for punishment. 
6. Intentional verbal harassment or public humiliation to provoke an inmate into a position that would justify the use of force is prohibited. 
7. Nothing in these rules is intended, or should be interpreted, as preventing an employee from taking reasonable measures to protect himself/herself, to protect the lives of others, stop disturbances or escapes, or prevent serious destruction of state property.

\(n\) Continued use of security restraints applied for a time period longer than eight hours, and every eight hours thereafter, shall require the written approval of the functional unit manager or designee in addition to the requirements of sections \(j\), \(k\), and \(l\) above.

\(o\) Continued use of the restraint chair for a time period longer than two hours, and every two hours thereafter, shall require the written or verbal approval of the functional unit manager or designee in addition to the requirements of sections \(j\), \(k\), and \(l\) above. The use of the restraint chair shall not exceed ten consecutive hours.

\(p\) Continued use of the restraint chair for a time period longer than two hours, and every two hours thereafter, during the transporting of an inmate shall require the verbal approval of the functional unit manager or designee. The use of the restraint chair shall not exceed ten consecutive hours during transport.

* \(A\) The officer-in-charge of the transport shall ensure that observation of the inmate is maintained and documented on the Trip Documentation Sheet every 30 minutes. The officer-in-charge shall ensure that the inmate is evaluated by a health care professional once the final destination is reached.
* \(B\) Placing an inmate in the restraint chair shall be considered a use of force within the context of these rules, except when the restraint chair is being utilized as additional seating for inmates during transfers.

\(q\) Therapeutic Restraints: The documentation, application, and use of therapeutic restraints will not be considered a use of force situation, but shall be in accordance with the department’s rule on Therapeutic Restraints \(OAR 291-071\). Therapeutic restraints will be:

* \(A\) Applied to an inmate only for medical or mental health treatment to limit the inmate’s movement; and
* \(B\) Applied to an inmate only upon the documented verbal or written order of a physician, except in the absence of a physician, a registered nurse may authorize the application of therapeutic restraints for a period not to exceed one hour.

### 4. Chemical Agents, Electronic Control Devices, Batons, Water Force and Specialty Impact Munitions:

\(a\) The use of chemical agents other than aerosol spray, electronic control devices, batons, water force, and specialty impact munitions shall be authorized only by the functional unit manager or designee. The decision to use chemical agents, electronic control devices, batons, water force, and specialty impact munitions shall be based on the level of force that, in the judgment of the functional unit manager or designee, is most likely to resolve the situation with the least amount of injury to all parties involved.
