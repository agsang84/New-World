Statutory/Other Authority: ORS 179.040, 423.020, 423.030 & 423.075 Statutes/Other Implemented: ORS 179.040, 423.020, 423.030 & 423.075 History: CD 2-1993, f. 1-25-93, cert. ef. 2-1-93, Renumbered from 291-061-0060 CD 6-1987, f. & ef. 1-20-87 CD 54-1986\(Temp\), f. 11-20-86, ef. 12-31-86 291-061-0190 Manual Cleaning of Utensils and Equipment

\(1\) Manual washing and sanitizing may be practiced for small batches of utensils and for equipment that cannot be conveniently or effectively cleaned by mechanical warewashing machines. A three-compartment sink with each compartment of sufficient size to allow immersion of the largest multi-use utensil is required. A two-compartment sink of a size allowing immersion of each utensil is allowed only if hot water is used to sanitize.

\(2\) Each sink compartment shall be supplied with hot and cold potable running water.

\(3\) Each dishwashing facility shall be equipped with drainboards or sorting tables, one for soiled utensils and a separate one for clean utensils. They shall be of adequate size to handle peak washing loads in a sanitary manner.

\(4\) Wooden racks, toweling, absorbent materials, or other materials which are not easily cleanable will not be used on drainboards and dish tables.

\(5\) Fixed equipment or equipment too large to be cleaned in a sink compartment shall be cleaned and sanitized in place. Cleaning shall be by manual washing or by pressure spray.

\(6\) Washing, rinsing, and sanitizing shall be in the following sequence when done manually:

\(a\) Equipment and utensils shall be thoroughly washed in the first compartment with a hot detergent solution of at least 120 degrees Fahrenheit;

\(b\) Equipment and utensils shall be rinsed free of detergents and abrasive with clean hot water in the second compartment;

\(c\) Equipment and utensils shall be sanitized in accordance with section \(7\) of this rule. The sanitizers of choice are hot water, chlorine, iodine, or quaternary ammonium compounds formulated and labeled for use on food contact surfaces.

\(7\) Food contact surfaces of all equipment and utensils shall be sanitized by:

\(a\) Immersion for at least 1/2 minute in clean, hot water at a temperature of at least 170 degrees Fahrenheit; or

\(b\) Immersion for at least one minute in a clean solution containing 50 to 100 parts per million of available chlorine as hypochlorite and at a temperature of at least 75 degrees Fahrenheit; or

\(c\) Immersion for at least one minute in a clean solution containing 12.5 to 25 parts per million of available iodine and having a pH not higher than 5.0 at a temperature of at least 75 degrees Fahrenheit; or

\(d\) Immersion for at least one minute in a clean solution of quaternary ammonium at a solution strength of 200 parts per million;

\(e\) Other methods of washing and sanitizing utensils and other sanitizing compounds may be accepted by the Health Division Administrator upon application from the institution or state agency operating the institution. The application must provide proof that the method is consistently effective and safe; that any chemicals used are manufactured for use on food contact surfaces and are registered as such with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; and that the label instructions comply with minimum requirements of this rule;

\(f\) Rinsing or spraying with a chemical sanitizing solution of at least twice the strength required for that particular sanitizing solution under subsection \(7\)\(b\) or \(c\) of this rule in sanitizing of fixed equipment or equipment too large to be sanitized in a sink compartment. Because of its potential toxicity, quaternary ammonium may not be used in excess of 200 parts per million and is, therefore, unsuitable as a spray or rinse for fixed equipment.

\(8\) When hot water is the method of sanitizing, the following shall be used:

\(a\) A heating device installed on or under the sanitizing compartment of the sink in a manner which would prevent any direct contact by the operator. The heating device must be able to maintain the water at a temperature of at least 170 degrees Fahrenheit;

\(b\) A thermometer, accurate to plus or minus three degrees Fahrenheit, shall be kept close to the sink for frequent checks of water temperature; and

\(c\) Dish baskets shall be large enough to permit complete covering of the tableware, kitchenware, and equipment by the hot water.

\(9\) Every establishment in which chemical sanitizers are used shall provide a testing kit or device that will accurately measure the concentration in parts per million for each sanitizer used. Dishwashing personnel shall test frequently the level of the sanitizer in solution.

\(10\) Notwithstanding sections \(1\) through \(8\) of this rule, any institutional kitchen having no multi-use utensil or no equipment which comes into contact with readily perishable foods or beverages shall not be required to provide three sink compartments so long as all other requirements of sections \(1\) through \(9\) of this rule are followed including the washing, rinsing and sanitizing sequence.

\(e\) Drain boards shall be provided and be of adequate size for the proper handling of soiled utensils prior to washing and cleaning of utensils following sanitization. This does not preclude the use of easily movable dish tables for the storage of cleaned utensils following sanitization. Wooden racks, toweling, absorbent materials or other materials which are not easily cleanable will not be used on drainboards and dish tables.

\(f\) Equipment and utensils shall be flushed or scraped and, when necessary, soaked to remove gross food particles and soil prior to being washed in a dishwashing machine operation unless a prewash cycle is a part of the dishwashing machine. Equipment and utensils shall be placed in racks, trays, baskets, or on conveyors in a way that food contact surfaces are exposed to the unobstructed application of detergent wash and clean rinse waters and in a way that permits free draining.

\(g\) Domestic or home-style dishwashers shall not be used unless modified by the manufacturer or factory representative to meet specifications of water pressure, water temperature, and cycling control in subsections \(1\) through \(3\) of this rule.

\(e\) The chemical sanitizing rinse water temperature shall not be less than the manufacturer's recommended temperature and in no case less than 75 degrees Fahrenheit; and

\(f\) A test kit or other device that accurately measures the parts per million concentration of the sanitizing solution shall be provided by the institution and shall be used regularly to assure proper concentrations.

\(3\) Machines using hot water for sanitizing may be used provided the following requirements are satisfied in addition to subsection \(1\) of this rule:

\(a\) The wash water and pumped rinse water shall be kept clean.

\(b\) The water shall be maintained at a minimum of 120 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit for the wash cycle.

\(c\) The rinse cycle shall be 160 degrees Fahrenheit as measured at the level of the dish rack.

\(d\) The pressure during the rinse cycle shall be 15 to 25 pounds per square inch.

\(4\) Drying: After sanitizing, all equipment and utensils shall be air dried. Utensils may not be rinsed after the sanitizing cycle, and towel drying may not be practiced.
