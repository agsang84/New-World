\(b\) Examine alternatives to achieving the Department’s project or action, including possible modification of the proposed project or action, or withdrawal of the proposal;

\(c\) Appeal of local government denials of Department of Corrections requests for land use approvals or compatibility determinations when determined to be necessary by the Department; or
