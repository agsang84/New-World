\(c\) Male inmates sentenced to death will be delivered by the sheriff to the Oregon State Penitentiary. Female inmates sentenced to death will be delivered by the sheriff to the Coffee Creek Correctional Facility.

\(d\) In extraordinary circumstances where intensive confinement or special immediate treatment of an inmate is essential; e.g., medical/mental health problems, the sheriff may deliver the inmate directly to an approved department facility other than the designated department intake facility. In such cases, the sheriff must obtain prior approval by contacting the Department of Correction’s Population Management Administrator or designee.

\(e\) Upon receipt of the judgment and the time served certification, the Offender Information and Sentence Computation Unit \(OISC\) staff will establish a case file and compute the inmate’s sentence.

\(f\) In the event the sheriff does not deliver a time served certification with the inmate, the department will accept a time served certification by fax, mail, or teletype at OISC.

\(g\) If a time served certification is received after admission of the inmate, the OISC staff designated to perform sentence calculation shall amend the sentence computation pursuant to ORS 137.370 and send a copy of the amended face sheet, along with the new time served certification to the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision.

\(h\) Parole violators will be accepted at the designated Department of Corrections intake facility with a revocation order issued by the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision chairperson, or for a Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision warrant from out-of-state.

\(1\) Prior Convictions for ORS 137.635 Predicate Crimes:

\(a\) For purposes of ORS 137.635, an inmate has a prior conviction for an 137.635 predicate crime if the inmate committed and was previously convicted for one of the crimes listed in 137.635 prior to the commission of an 137.635 crime for which the inmate is currently sentenced.

\(b\) A prior conviction for an ORS 137.635 predicate crime may have occurred either before, or on or after January 1, 1990, the effective date of 137.635.

\(c\) A prior conviction for an ORS 137.635 predicate crime may be a prior conviction from another state or federal jurisdiction that is the equivalent of a listed 137.635 felony crime.

\(d\) Determination of a prior conviction for an ORS 137.635 predicate crime:

\(A\) For crimes committed on or after January 1, 1990 with judgments entered prior to August 23, 1993, OISC staff will determine whether an inmate has a qualifying prior conviction for an ORS 137.635 predicate crime and whether an inmate is subject to the sentencing provisions of 137.635. If a prior conviction for an 137.635 predicate crime is from another state or federal jurisdiction, OISC staff will obtain documents necessary to verify that the elements of the predicate felony crime for which the inmate was previously convicted are identical to the elements of one or more of the ten felony crimes listed in 137.635.

\(B\) For crimes committed on or after January 1, 1990 with judgments entered on or after August 23, 1993, the court will determine whether an inmate has a qualifying prior conviction for an ORS 137.635 predicate crime and whether an inmate is subject to the sentencing provisions of 137.635.

\(2\) Qualifying ORS 137.635 Convictions:

\(a\) An inmate who is currently convicted of one or more ORS 137.635 crimes committed on or after January 1, 1990, who is sentenced by the court to a determinate sentence and who has a prior conviction for an 137.635 predicate crime is subject to the sentence computation requirements of 137.635 on the qualifying second or repeat conviction.

\(b\) An inmate who receives two or more qualifying ORS 137.635 convictions arising out of the same criminal episode \(e.g., convictions are separate counts in the same criminal case, convictions arise in the same court appearance\), is not subject to an 137.635 sentence as a result of the convictions, unless the inmate has a prior conviction for an 137.635 predicate crime.

The inmate may be released on the Wednesday or Thursday immediately prior to the release date if the release date interferes with community supervision or transitional planning.

\(2\) Approval Process: To request an adjusted release, the following process will occur:

\(a\) The institution counselor shall send the release plan/packet to the county community corrections office when the inmate has no less than 90 days remaining prior to their scheduled release. If the institution counselor determines a Friday release could be problematic, he/she will note this on the release plan/packet with a brief explanation why; i.e., bus schedule. The institution counselor shall document all early release actions in the computer system.

\(b\) Upon receiving the release plan/packet, community corrections staff shall request an early release by submitting a written request to the institution counselor when there is no less than 60 days remaining prior to the projected release date. In the written request, community corrections staff shall indicate a preferred release date \(Wednesday or Thursday\), briefly explain circumstances that make the release date problematic, briefly describe why the release date may interfere with community supervision or transitional planning, and briefly describe a plan for receiving the inmate. Community corrections staff should document all early release actions in the computer system \(chronos\).

\(c\) Upon receiving an adjusted release request from community corrections staff, the institution counselor shall submit a Release Date Adjustment form \(CD 1417\) to the designated Central Office staff for approval within 14 days of receiving the request from the county community corrections. The institution counselor shall document in the computer system \(chronos\) that an early release request was received from community corrections staff and a Release Date Adjustment form was submitted to Central Office.

\(d\) Upon receiving an adjusted release request from an institution counselor, the designated Central Office staff shall respond to the institution counselor within seven days of receiving the request. Realizing that situations change, requests not received within the above timeframes will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

\(3\) Communication Process:

\(a\) Upon approval of the requested adjusted release by the designated Central Office staff, the institution counselor will notify the county community corrections office, Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision, and inmate of the new release date. The counselor will also notify OISC of the new release date by providing the facility’s OISC institution office with a copy of the approved Release Date Adjustment form.

\(b\) If the adjusted release is denied by the designated Central Office staff, the institution counselor will notify the county community corrections office and inmate of the denial and provide the facility’s OISC institution office with a signed copy of the denied Release Date Adjustment form.

\(c\) If a release date changes and there is no longer a need for an adjusted release date, the designated Central Office staff will write “canceled” across the top of the Adjusted Release Date form and send a copy to the institution counselor who will forward a copy to the county community corrections office, Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision, inmate, and the facility’s OISC institution office.
