## 291-109-0100 Authority, Purpose, and Policy

\(1\) Authority: The authority for these rules is granted to the Director of the Department of Corrections in accordance with ORS 179.040, 423.020, 423.030, and 423.075.

\(2\) Purpose: The purpose of these rules is to establish department policy and procedures for inmate communication with staff and the administration of the department’s internal grievance review and appeal system for inmates confined in Department of Corrections facilities.

\(3\) Policy:

\(a\) It is the policy of the Department of Corrections to encourage inmates to address their concerns informally with appropriate staff and managers through either dialog or by utilizing inmate communication forms. Inmates having information or concerns regarding the conduct or behavior of staff that may directly threaten the life, health, and safety of staff or inmates are also encouraged to communicate their information and concerns to the department using such other systems as the department may develop, for example, the Inspector General’s hotline.

\(b\) Recognizing that due to the complex nature of the correctional setting some issues or disputes between staff and inmates may not be readily resolved at an informal level, it is the policy of the Department of Corrections to permit and encourage inmates to seek resolution of issues or disputes using the department’s internal inmate grievance review and appeal system established in these rules.

\(c\) Within the inherent limitations of resources and the need for facility security, safety, health and good order, it is the policy of the Department of Corrections that all inmates be treated fairly and equitably, and that staff actions and decisions be consistent with the rules, policies and procedures of the department.

\(2\) Inmates shall communicate with staff in a civil and respectful tone and manner.

\(3\) Staff shall communicate with inmates in a professional manner that fosters respect and confidence. Staff orders directed to inmates should be clear and concise.

\(4\) Staff should make every effort to respond to an inmate communication form within seven days of receipt.

\(3\) Grievances alleging sexual abuse must be submitted to the functional unit grievance coordinator on the departments approved inmate grievance form \(CD117\). The grievance should have the words “sexual abuse grievance” clearly written on the top of the grievance form.

\(4\) There is no time limit on when an inmate may submit a grievance regarding an allegation of sexual abuse.

\(b\) If the inmate declines to have the request processed on his or her behalf, the agency shall document the inmate’s decision.

\(6\) The grievance coordinator may not refer a grievance alleging sexual abuse to a staff member who is the subject of the grievance.

\(c\) At any level of the administrative process, including the final level, if the inmate does not receive a response within the time allotted for reply, including any properly noticed extension, the inmate may consider the absence of a response to be a denial of the allegations made by the inmate at that level.

\(a\) After receiving an emergency grievance alleging an inmate is subject to a substantial risk of imminent sexual abuse, the OIC or the OIC’s designee shall immediately review and take immediate corrective action as necessary to mitigate the risk of sexual assault.
