#### 291-041-0020 - Inmates

1. Search of inmates, living units, work areas, other places they inhabit or frequent, and their property will be conducted regularly on an unannounced and unscheduled basis.
2. An inspection of each cell, room or dormitory area will occur prior to occupancy by a new inmate.
3. In conducting searches of an inmate's living unit, place of work, or other places frequented or inhabited, the employee conducting the search will be expected to leave the search area in an orderly and neat condition. Care will be exercised to ensure that authorized property is not damaged or disposed of.
4. Inmates may be subject to search at any time; but no more frequently than is necessary to control contraband or to recover stolen or missing property. However, all inmates will be subject to a search on each occasion before and after they leave a Department of Corrections facility, and on each occasion before and after visits, entering or exiting special housing units and before or after contact with persons outside the facility.
5. The type of search administered will avoid unnecessary force, embarrassment, or indignity to the inmate. Non-intrusive sensors and inspection devices may be used when appropriate.
6. Clothed Searches: Inmates may be searched only by authorized Department of Corrections personnel or a sworn police officer in the performance of his/her official duty. Cross-gender clothed searches of female inmates will not occur unless there is an emergency, and shall be documented.
7. Unclothed Searches: Unclothed searches conducted by DOC staff will be of the same gender as the inmate, unless there is an emergency. Except in emergencies, inmates undergoing unclothed searches will be removed to a private area for the search.

\(a\) The facility shall document all unclothed searches to include cross-gender and cross-gender visual body cavity searches.

\(b\) The facility shall not search or physically examine a transgender or intersex inmate for the sole purpose of determining the inmate’s genital status.

\(c\) If the inmate’s genital status is unknown, it may be determined during conversations with the inmate, by reviewing medical records, or, if necessary, by learning that information as part of a broader medical examination conducted in private by a medical practitioner.

1. Visual inspections for security reasons may be conducted by authorized personnel. All internal examinations must be conducted by medical personnel only upon authorization of the functional unit manager or the officer-of-the-day and only when there is reasonable suspicion as defined in OAR 291-041-0010\(16\) to justify the search. The inmate's written consent will not be required; however, an internal search will not be conducted if it could result in injury to the inmate or the personnel conducting the search.
2. Hair:

\(a\) If staff need to conduct a hair search, it may be necessary to require the inmate to unbraid, loosen or cut the hair to complete the search.

\(b\) The inmate will be given an adequate amount of time to unbraid or loosen the hair.

\(c\) An inmate who refuses to unbraid or loosen the hair is subject to disciplinary action in accordance with the rule on Prohibited Inmate Conduct and Processing of Disciplinary Actions \(OAR 291-105\).

\(d\) If the inmate is unable to unbraid or loosen the hair so a search can be accomplished, staff shall conduct the search if possible in the least intrusive manner \(e.g., hand wand, visual inspection, etc.\). _**At no time shall staff cut an inmate’s hair to complete a search WITHOUT approval of the functional unit manager or officer-of-the-day.**_

\(e\) If an inmate’s hair creates a significant security or operational concern, a religious sincerity test may be conducted. Based on the results of the sincerity test, the functional unit manager or designee will determine what further action shall be taken.

#### 291-041-0035 - Visitors

1. When to Search: A search of a visitor will generally occur only when the visitor consents and there is reasonable suspicion that the visitor is in possession of contraband, and that the search and confiscation is vitally necessary to substantiate the suspected violation.

\(a\) Consent is not required when a delay or non-consent would constitute a direct and immediate threat to the safety and security of the facility.

\(b\) Consent is not required when the search is conducted pursuant to an arrest or to protect the safety of staff or other persons.

1. If a Crime is Suspected: If alleged commission of a criminal offense is involved, the matter will fall within the jurisdiction of appropriate law enforcement agencies, which will be promptly notified.
2. Conduct the Search: Searches of visitors at a Department of Corrections facility will be conducted at the direction of the functional unit manager or designee, or the Department of Corrections Inspector General or designee, based upon reasonable suspicion that the visitor is in possession of unauthorized property or contraband.

\(a\) Visitor searches may be conducted by authorized Corrections staff or by an authorized law enforcement officer. If requested, authorized Corrections staff may assist law enforcement officers in conducting any search, investigation, or arrest of a visitor. Searches conducted by DOC staff shall be the same gender as the visitor.

\(b\) Adequate facilities must be provided for the search which shall be done in a professional manner so as not to cause undue embarrassment to the visitor. The subject of the search will be advised of search procedures \(i.e., removal of clothing, visual inspection of cavities, etc.\) prior to the search.

\(c\) If an internal examination is indicated, this shall be done only by competent medical personnel at the direction of the law enforcement official conducting the search.

1. After Search or Inspection: Those individuals who refuse to be searched or, who after being searched were found to be in possession of unauthorized property or contraband, shall have their visiting status immediately suspended and will be sanctioned as provided in the Department of Corrections rule on Visiting \(Inmate\) \(OAR 291-127\).
