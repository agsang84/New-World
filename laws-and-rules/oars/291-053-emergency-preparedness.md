\(b\) Emergency preparedness is essential in assuring the protection of the public, facility and life.

\(c\) Emergency preparedness enables employees to maintain and restore humane and professional conditions of incarceration as quickly and safely as possible.

\(2\) Each DOC facility shall develop emergency plans to respond to emergency situations.

\(3\) The department shall assign a management employee to perform the duties of the department emergency coordinator.

\(2\) Prediction of emergencies requires the identification, reporting and authentication of disturbance factors.

\(3\) Emergencies can often be predicted if disturbance factors can be properly evaluated. Each DOC facility will utilize a "Risk Assessment” designed to predict the degree of possibility for an emergency.

\(4\) Each DOC facility shall perform a risk assessment annually to identify the potential for an emergency based on the geographic location, inmate population, facility structure and facility resources. The internal and external factors that would threaten the facility will be listed on a form titled "Risk Assessment by Type of Emergency." This form will be kept current and maintained in the Emergency Preparedness Manual. A copy will be sent to the department emergency coordinator.

\(5\) Each DOC facility shall develop emergency plans to respond to each predicted emergency identified on the "Risk Assessment by Type of Emergency."
