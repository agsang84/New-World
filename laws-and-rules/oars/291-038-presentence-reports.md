If the crime of conviction is subclassified in accordance with Criminal Justice Commission rules 291-018-0000 to 291-018-0090 and 213-019-0000 to 213-019-0015, the presentence report shall state the factual circumstances that justify the proposed subclassification.  \(b\) A listing of all prior adult felony and Class A misdemeanor convictions and all prior juvenile adjudications and an assessment of the appropriate classification of the criminal history on the Criminal History Scale in accordance with Criminal Justice Commission rules OAR 213-004-0006 to 213-004-0013.  \(c\) An analysis of the disposition that is most likely to reduce the defendant’s criminal conduct and why such disposition would have the desired effect.  \(d\) An assessment of the availability to the defendant of any relevant programs or treatment, both in and out of custody, whether provided by the Department of Corrections or another entity.  \(e\) A proposed grid block classification for each crime of conviction and the presumptive sentence for each crime of conviction.  **\(A\)** If the proposed grid block classification is a grid block above the dispositional line, the presentence report shall state the presumptive prison term range and the presumptive duration of post-prison supervision.  **\(B\)** If the proposed grid block classification is grid block 8-G, 8-H, or 8-I, the presentence report shall state whether the offender is eligible for an optional probationary sentence. If the offender is eligible, the presentence report may include a recommendation that an optional probationary sentence be imposed with a further recommendation for the appropriate conditions of probation designed to reduce future criminal conduct.  **\(C\)** If the proposed grid block classification is a grid block below the dispositional line, the presentence report shall provide the following information:  - **\(i\)** The presumptive term of probation; - **\(ii\)** The maximum number of custody units that may be imposed and the number of custody units that may be used to impose jail time as part of the probationary sentence; - **\(iii\)** A recommendation for the appropriate conditions of probation including both custody and non-custody conditions; and - **\(iv\)** Any other information relevant to the imposition of a presumptive sentence as provided by these rules.  \(f\) Contain a recommendation as to whether a departure from the guidelines is appropriate.

When a presentence report is made, the preparer of the report shall:

1. Make a reasonable effort to contact the victim and obtain a statement describing the effect of the defendant’s offense upon the victim.

2. If the victim is under 18 years of age, obtain the consent of the victim’s parents of guardian before contacting the victim. 
3. Include the statement of the victim in the presentence investigation report. 
4. If unable to contact the victim or if the victim declines to make a statement, report that he/she was unable to contact the victim after making reasonable efforts to do so, or if the contact was made with the victim, that the victim declined to make a statement. 
5. Before taking a statement from the victim, inform the victim that the statement will be made available to the defendant and the defendant’s counsel prior to sentencing as required under ORS 137.079. The report shall be recorded in the Corrections Information System to be accessed by authorized personnel.
