5. Disclosures by Mediator. A mediator may not disclose or be compelled to disclose mediation communications in a mediation and, if disclosed, such communications may not be introduced into evidence in any subsequent administrative, judicial or arbitration proceeding unless:  \(a\) All the parties to the mediation and the mediator agree in writing to the disclosure; or,  \(b\) The mediation communication may be disclosed or introduced into evidence in a subsequent proceeding as provided in subsections \(c\) or \(h\)–\(l\) of section \(7\) of this rule. 
6. Confidentiality and Inadmissibility of Mediation Communications. Except as provided in section \(7\) of this rule, mediation communications in mediations involving workplace interpersonal disputes are confidential and may not be disclosed to any other person, are not admissible in any subsequent administrative, judicial or arbitration proceeding and may not be disclosed during testimony in, or during any discovery conducted as part of a subsequent proceeding, or introduced into evidence by the parties or the mediator in any subsequent proceeding so long as:  \(a\) The parties to the mediation and the agency have agreed in writing to the confidentiality of the mediation; and  \(b\) The person agreeing to the confidentiality of the mediation on behalf of the agency:  _**\(A\)**_ Is neither a party to the dispute nor the mediator; and  _**\(B\)**_ Is designated by the agency to authorize confidentiality for the mediation; and  _**\(C\)**_ Is at the same or higher level in the agency than any of the parties to the mediation or who is a person with responsibility for human resources or personnel matters in the agency, unless the agency head or member of the governing board is one of the persons involved in the interpersonal dispute, in which case the Governor or the Governor's designee. 
7. Exceptions to Confidentiality and Inadmissibility.  \(a\) Any statements, memoranda, work products, documents and other materials, otherwise subject to discovery that were not prepared specifically for use in the mediation are not confidential and may be disclosed or introduced into evidence in a subsequent proceeding.  \(b\) Any mediation communications that are public records, as defined in ORS 192.410\(4\), and were not specifically prepared for use in the mediation are not confidential and may be disclosed or introduced into evidence in a subsequent proceeding unless the substance of the communication is confidential or privileged under state or federal law.  \(c\) A mediation communication is not confidential and may be disclosed by any person receiving the communication to the extent that person reasonably believes that disclosing the communication is necessary to prevent the commission of a crime that is likely to result in death or bodily injury to any person.

At the request of a party, the court may seal any part of the record of the proceeding to prevent further disclosure of the mediation communications or agreements  \(i\) To the extent a mediation communication contains information the substance of which is required to be disclosed by Oregon statute, other than ORS 192.410 to 192.505, that portion of the communication may be disclosed as required by statute.  \(j\) The mediator may report the disposition of a mediation to the agency at the conclusion of the mediation so long as the report does not disclose specific confidential mediation communications.

Any term of an agreement that requires an expenditure of public funds, other than expenditures of $1,000 or less for employee training, employee counseling or purchases of equipment that remain the property of the agency, may not be made confidential. 
9. When a mediation is subject to section \(6\) of this rule, the agency will provide to all parties to the mediation and to the mediator a copy of this rule or an explanation of where a copy of the rule may be obtained. The mediation confidentiality agreement must also refer to this rule. Violation of this provision does not waive confidentiality or inadmissibility.
