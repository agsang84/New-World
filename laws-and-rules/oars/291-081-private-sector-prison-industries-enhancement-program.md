# 291-081 - Private Sector Prison Industries Enhancement Program

Department of Corrections Chapter 291 Division 81 PRIVATE SECTOR/PRISON INDUSTRIES ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM 

## 291-081-0010 Authority, Purpose, and Policy

\(1\) Authority: The authority for this rule is granted to the Director of the Department of Corrections in accordance with ORS 179.040, 421.440, 423.020, 423.030, 423.075, Oregon Laws 1997, Ch. 851, and Article I, Section 41 of the Oregon Constitution.

\(2\) Purpose:

\(a\) The purpose of this rule is to establish Department of Corrections policy and procedures governing the operation and administration of its Private Sector/Prison Industries Enhancement \(PS/PIE\) Program and work projects certified under the federal Prison Industry Enhancement Certification Program \(PIECP\);

\(b\) These rules apply only to inmates working on PS/PIE Program work projects when the goods manufactured will be transported in interstate commerce, except the inmates noted as follows. These rules do not apply to inmates involved in the production of agricultural commodities or parts for the repair of farm machinery, nor do they apply to inmates involved in the production of commodities intended for use by the federal government, the District of Columbia, any state or political subdivisions thereof, or not-for-profit organizations. These rules also do not apply to inmates who produce goods solely for intrastate transport, and inmates on parole, supervised release or probation.

\(3\) Policy: The Department of Corrections recognizes the value of fully engaging inmates in productive activities, such as PS/PIE Program work projects, if inmates are to successfully re-enter society with practical skills and a viable work ethic. Consistent with the mandate of Article I, section 41 of the Oregon Constitution requiring sufficient work and training programs to ensure that eligible inmates are productively involved in work and training programs, the Department of Corrections will seek opportunities to enter into agreements with private business concerns to accomplish the production or marketing of goods produced by inmates.
