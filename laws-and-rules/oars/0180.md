Fugitives from Justice

Application Fee for Interstate Compact Transfers

(1) Payment of NonRefundable Application Fee Required:

(a) Offenders on probation, parole, or post-prison supervision who request transfer of their supervision to another state under the compact must submit a nonrefundable application fee of $50 to the supervisory authority. The fee must be received by the supervisory authority before the Department of Corrections will process the offender’s transfer request.

(b) Payment of an additional application fee will not be required of offenders for processing revised or subsequent requests for transfer of their supervision to the same state. However, offenders who request transfer of their supervision to the same state after being returned to Oregon from the receiving state from a previous compact transfer, and offenders that make a subsequent request for transfer of their supervision to a different state must pay a new application fee.

(2) The supervisory authority shall collect the application fee and forward it to the Governor’s Office for deposit in the Arrest and Return Account as defined in ORS 133.865.

(a) The fee shall be paid and collected in the form of a bank money order or cashier’s check made payable and mailed to “State of Oregon, c/o Director of Extradition Services, Governor’s Office, Room 160 State Capitol Building, Salem, OR 97310”

(b) The payment should be identified as an Interstate Compact Application fee and include the offender’s name and SID number.

(3) The application fee is not subject to waiver; however, upon the recommendation of the supervisory authority, the Department of Corrections may reduce the amount of the fee by up to 50%. In determining if a fee reduction is warranted, the supervisory authority shall consider:

(a) The offender’s financial resources;

(b) The burden the application fee will impose in light of the offender’s overall obligations;

(c) The rehabilitative effect of the application fee and compact transfer; and

(d) The community’s interests in the transfer of the offender.

Limited exceptions may be granted by the Compact Administrator or designee based on individual circumstances.

(2) This rule applies to all offenders applying for a transfer of their supervision to another state under the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision (ICAOS) before, on or after January 1, 2012, whose applications have not been previously approved by the Department of Corrections.
