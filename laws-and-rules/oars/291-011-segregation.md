## **291-011-0005 - Authority, Purpose, and Policy**

1. The authority for this rule is granted to the Director of the Department of Corrections in accordance with ORS 179.040, 423.020, 423.030 and 423.075. 
2. Purpose: To establish procedures and standards for the placing and maintenance of inmates in disciplinary segregation. Inmates in violation of rules of prohibited conduct are placed in disciplinary segregation. 
3. Policy: It is the policy of the Department of Corrections to establish and maintain disciplinary segregation operations separate from the main inmate population in Department of Corrections facilities. This rule cannot cover all possible events; it is intended to direct only the relative routine aspects of segregation operations. Inmates in disciplinary segregation status will be treated fairly and impartially with the best interest of staff, inmates, and the institution in mind.

## **291-011-0010 - Definitions**

1. Close Supervision Status: Placement of an inmate so that he/she is more restricted than other inmates in disciplinary segregation status. This status is designated for inmates whose actions disrupt the safe and orderly operation of disciplinary segregation. 
2. Disciplinary Segregation: The placement of an inmate in a housing program status which separates him/her from the main population of the facility in accordance with Department of Corrections rule on Prohibited Inmate Conduct and Processing Disciplinary Actions \(OAR 291-105\). 
3. Disciplinary Segregation Supervisor: That person designated by the functional unit manager to oversee the daily operation of the Disciplinary Segregation Unit \(DSU\). 
4. Dry Cell Status: A visual inspection process which, after reasonable suspicion has been established, allows for the placement of an inmate in a cell for the safe recovery of internally concealed foreign substances, instruments, and other contraband. 
5. Functional Unit Manager: Any person within the Department of Corrections who reports to either the Director, or Assistant Director, or administrator and has responsibility for the delivery of program services or the coordination of program operations. In a correctional facility, the superintendent is the functional unit manager. 
6. Long-Term Status: Any inmate confined in segregation status or in disciplinary segregation for 30 or more consecutive days. 
7. Mental Health Professional: An individual who by virtue of his/her education, credentials, and experience is permitted to care for the mental health needs of patients.

11. Qualified Health Care Professional: This includes physicians, physician assistants, nurses, nurse practitioners, dentists, mental health professionals and others who by virtue of their education, credentials and experience are permitted by law to evaluate and care for patients. 
12. Reasonable Suspicion: An apparent state of objective facts and rational inferences drawn there from which would permit a reasonable and experienced correctional staff person to conclude that an inmate is possessing contraband or is committing a crime or rule violation or conspiring or attempting the same.
