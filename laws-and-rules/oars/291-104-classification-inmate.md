\(1\) The Department of Corrections shall assign inmates an initial custody level in accordance with the Custody Classification Guide \(Attachment 1\) or the inmate’s Violence Predictor Score, whichever is higher. An inmate will generally be assigned an initial custody classification level within 30 days of admission to the physical custody of the Department of Corrections.

\(2\) The Violence Predictor Score is used as a classification scoring element only during the first twelve months of an inmate’s incarceration in the Department of Corrections, and may be applied at the discretion of a Department of Corrections counselor after a thorough review of an inmate’s records.

\(3\) Upon admission to the physical custody of the Department of Corrections, the inmate’s assigned counselor will determine an inmate’s initial custody level and forward the classification action to the functional unit manager or designee for approval.

\(4\) No classification action is official until the functional unit manager or designee approves the classification action.

\(5\) Final approval for any override of one step will be made by Intake or institution staff and shall be documented on the classification override comment screen, describing the override reason.

\(6\) A custody classification override of more than a single step is not official until approved by the designated institution committee and the Classification Manager or designee.

\(7\) A custody classification of Level 5 is not official until approved by the designated institution committee, the SPM Committee and the High Risk Placement Manager or designee.

\(8\) An inmate may request a copy of his/her official classification action.

\(9\) All official classification actions are historically recorded and maintained in the CIS system.

\(10\) The Office of Population Management may modify any classification. In such cases, the affected facility will be notified of the reason\(s\) for the modification.

\(1\) An inmate’s custody classification level will be reviewed when new information is received that affects a classification scoring policy element or when an inmate’s Violence Predictor Score has expired.

\(2\) Custody Classification Levels 1–4: When new information is received that affects the inmate’s custody classification level, the inmate’s assigned counselor will review the classification action for accuracy and forward it to the functional unit manager for approval.

\(a\) No classification action is official until the functional unit manager or designee approves the classification action.

\(b\) Final approval for any override of one step will be made at the institutional level and shall be documented on the classification override comment screen describing the override reason.

\(c\) Overrides of more than a single step are not official until approved by the designated institution committee and the Classification Manager or designee.

\(d\) An inmate may request a copy of his/her official classification action.

\(e\) All official classification actions are historically recorded and maintained in the CIS.

\(f\) The Office of Population Management may modify any classification action. In such cases, the affected facility will be formally notified of the reason\(s\) for the modification.

\(g\) Counselors may opt to review inmates with ICE detainers for override to Level 2 for placement or retention in a minimum facility.

\(3\) Custody Classification Level 5:

\(a\) When an inmate’s institutional behavior is determined to create serious management concerns, the classification action will be reviewed by the designated institution committee and forwarded to the Special Population Management \(SPM\) Committee for review. If the SPM committee approves an inmate’s classification at Level 5, the Office of Population Management will add an IMU5 designator and generate a new classification, which will be scored as custody classification Level 5.

\(b\) Once an inmate is assigned to custody classification Level 5, the automated classification program will maintain the inmate’s Level 5 custody classification status until the IMU5 designator is removed, an IMUR designator is added, and a new classification is generated. The new classification will be scored at custody classification Level 4 for one year.

\(1\) An inmate may request an administrative review of his/her classification action by completing and submitting the Department of Corrections Request for Administrative Review form \(CD1120aD\) or Request for Administrative Review of IMU Level 5 Custody form \(CD1120aE\).

\(2\) Issues Subject to Administrative Review: Administrative review is available to an inmate to contest three aspects of his/her classification action:

\(a\) The accuracy of custody classification levels 1–4 scoring;

\(b\) An override of a scored custody classification level; or

\(c\) A Level 5 custody classification.

\(3\) Custody Classification Level 1-4 Accuracy of Scoring:

\(a\) To obtain an administrative review of a Level 1-4 custody classification score, an inmate must complete the top portion of a CD1120aD form, and send the completed form, together with any supporting documentation, to the designated institution committee at the facility where the inmate is currently housed. The institution committee must receive the request within 30 calendar days of the classification approval date. The institution committee should complete its review within 30 days after receiving an inmate's review request.

\(b\) If, after receiving the review decision of the designated institution committee, an inmate is not satisfied with the decision, the inmate may obtain further review of the custody classification Level 1–4 score by sending another completed CD1120aD form, together with any supporting documentation, and a copy of the institution committee's decision, to the functional unit manager or designee of the institution where the inmate is currently housed. The functional unit manager or designee must receive the review request within 30 calendar days of the institution committee's review decision. The functional unit manager or designee should complete his/her review within 30 days after receiving the inmate's review request. There shall be no further administrative review of a custody classification Level 1-4 score.

\(c\) Inmates engaged in the intake process may not submit a request for review of their custody classification score until they are no longer housed at the Intake Center.

\(4\) Override of a Scored Custody Classification Level 1–4: To obtain an administrative review of classification that has been overridden at the institution level, an inmate must complete the bottom portion of a CD1120aD form and send the completed form to the Classification Manager, together with any supporting documentation. The Classification Manager must receive the review request within 30 calendar days of the classification action approval date. The Classification Manager should complete the review within 30 days after receiving an inmate's review request. There shall be no further administrative review of an override decision.

\(5\) Level Five:

\(a\) To obtain an administrative review of a Level 5 custody classification, an inmate must complete the CD1120aD form and send it to the Classification Manager. The request for review by the inmate shall include any supporting documentation to be considered in reviewing the appropriateness of the Level 5 custody classification.

\(b\) If an inmate has been assigned to the Intensive Management Unit \(IMU\), the matter shall be reviewed only once while the inmate is completing IMU programming.

\(c\) If an inmate has been assigned to IMU and retained at custody Level 5 due to serious management concerns, the inmate will be provided a packet containing a Request for Administrative Review of Retention at Custody Classification Level 5/IMU \(CD1120aE\). An inmate may request further review of the Level 5 custody classification once annually.

\(6\) A copy of administrative review decisions will be provided to the inmate and retained in the inmate’s institution file.
