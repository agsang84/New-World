Written Agreements with Public and Private Agencies/Persons

No inmate will be assigned to work in the community without a written agreement between the Department of Corrections and the public or private agency or person with whom the inmate has secured authorized work. The agreement will set forth the nature and scope of the work to be performed by the inmate, and any terms or conditions of the inmate’s assignment and participation required by the Department. Any agreement will specifically set forth the payment which the Department will receive for the inmate’s labor and/or services, and for the costs of staff supervision (as applicable). Any agreement will also contain a provision requiring the public or private agency or person with whom the inmate has secured authorized work to furnish to the Department a regular accounting of the inmate’s work performance, behavior, and location.
