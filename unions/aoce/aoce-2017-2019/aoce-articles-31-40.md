### Section 2 - Position Descriptions

A. Individual position descriptions shall be reduced to writing and delineate the duties currently assigned to an employee’s position. A dated copy of the position description shall be given to the employee upon assuming the revised position. When the position description is amended it will be reviewed by the human resources manager prior to implementation and a signed copy shall be given to the employee and the Association upon implementation. The individual position description shall be subject to at least an annual review with the employee. Nothing contained herein shall compromise the right or the responsibility of the Agency to assign work consistent with the classification specification. 

B. The Association may otherwise request and shall receive copies of individual position descriptions at cost. Position descriptions provided to the Association per Section A will be at no cost to the Association. 

### Section 3

The employee seeking reclassification shall request the employee’s current position description and then review it with the employee’s immediate supervisor for accuracy. The employee shall receive an official position description signed by the supervisor within fourteen \(14\) calendar days of submission to the supervisor, or the employee can proceed to the next step without one. The employee will submit the official, signed position description or an unsigned version if the supervisor did not sign it, and a written explanation for the basis of the reclassification request to the Human Resources office within thirty \(30\) days of having given the description to the employee’s supervisor.

### Section 4

The Agency shall review the merits of the request. Within forty-five \(45\) days after receipt of the reclassification request, the Employer shall notify the Association of its decision. The Association shall have an opportunity before the forty-five \(45\) days decision date to meet with the Employer to present arguments and recommendations where there are objections to the proposed reclassification. The parties may extend the time limits by mutual written agreement in those instances where the review process or other extenuating circumstances require additional time for analysis.

### Section 5

Any employee who is involuntarily reclassified, or any employee whose reclassification is denied, may take the matter up as a grievance under Article 44, Grievance and Arbitration, of this Agreement. In the event that an arbitrator finds that the Employer failed to properly follow procedures in denying a reclass and further review finds a reclass is appropriate based on the same set of facts, the reclass will be effective on the first \(1st\) of the month following the month in which the reclass was first requested and received by the agency.

### Section 6

A. Should the duties of the position support the proposed reclassification, the Agency shall make the determination whether to seek legislative approval for reclassification or remove the duties. If a reclassification request, as approved, does not receive the necessary legislative approval, the Employer shall immediately change the duties of the employee to conform to the prior classification. An employee who is performing work in a higher classification shall be paid for that work in conformity with the provisions in [**Article 16**](aoce-articles-11-20.md#article-16-work-out-of-classification).

B. For Corrections Professionals, once a reclassification has been approved by the Classification / Compensation Unit of the Agency, and its implementation is being held pending permanent financing, the employee shall receive work out of classification pay.

If the employee's rate is above the highest step in the lower range, he/she shall receive no reduction in pay. Similarly, such employee shall not receive future salary adjustments until such time as the new range encompasses the employee's salary. At this time, the employee shall have a salary adjustment to the nearest step in the range. The employee shall also be placed on the layoff list for the previously-held classification.

### Section 10 - Reclassification Upward

Any employee reclassified upward shall move into the new range at the closest step that is higher than their current rate. Anniversary date for the future increases shall be established as the first \(1st\) of the month following the date the employee's request was received.

2. Effective on the first of the month after signing of this agreement if an employee returns or is returned to a lower classification in the correctional officer series for a reason other than layoff, the employee’s classification seniority shall only include the time previously spent in the lower classification. This shall not be applied to employees who demoted prior to the effective date.

### Section 2 - Non Custody Classifications

#### A. Overtime and Layoff

An employee who is placed on a layoff/recall list and who returns to the bargaining unit, shall upon recall retain all employment and classification seniority that the employee had prior to layoff, but shall not accumulate such seniority during the period of layoff.

An employee who has a break of service by virtue of voluntary termination of not more than ninety \(90\) days and returns to the bargaining unit shall retain the employee's previously accrued classification and employment seniority minus the time the employee was not in the bargaining unit.

An employee who voluntarily leaves the bargaining unit for a period of more than ninety \(90\) days, other than for layoff, or fails to respond within seven \(7\) consecutive days after receiving notice by registered letter mailed to the last address in the agency's records, unless prevented from responding by conditions beyond the employee's control, shall lose all classification and bargaining unit seniority.

An employee who involuntarily returns to the bargaining unit during a period of promotional trial service shall retain all previously accrued classification and bargaining unit seniority.

Notwithstanding Article 39, an employee who retires from Department of Corrections service shall lose all employment, classification and bargaining unit seniority except for the purposes of shift bidding.
