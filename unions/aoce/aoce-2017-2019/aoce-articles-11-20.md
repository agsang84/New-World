## ARTICLE 11 - SALARY ADMINISTRATION

### Section 1

Salary eligibility date is defined as the date an employee is eligible for an annual performance pay increase. The salary eligibility date is computed from the date of hire. Employees shall be eligible for annual performance pay increases on their salary eligibility date, provided the employee is not at the top of the salary range of his/her classification. The employee may be denied the annual performance pay increase if there has been a serious performance or attendance problem. Denials are subject to review within six \(6\) months. Denials may be grieved under the provisions of Article 44.

### Section 2

Any employee requiring an emergency draw shall be authorized once each calendar year to make such a draw without explanation. Additional draws may be requested in accord with existing policy and will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

### Section 3 - Submission of Salary Increases

A. For employees initially hired to state service, the salary eligibility date shall be set one \(1\) year from date of hire. However, an employee’s salary eligibility date may only change because of employment actions as a result of reallocations, trial service extensions as provided in Article 34, promotions, reemployments, reclassifications or leaves without pay in excess of thirty \(30\) days except those leaves protected by federal or state law \(FMLA, military, workers compensation\) and unpaid union leave up to ninety \(90\) days.

B. Salary payments to correct errors or oversights and retroactive payments resulting from grievance settlements will be authorized. In no event shall any retroactivity exceed twenty-four \(24\) months from the date upon which the oversight or error is brought to management's attention in writing, or in the case of a grievance settlement, thirty \(30\) days before the date the grievance was filed in writing.

### Section 4 - Salary on Lateral Transfer

A. An employee who transfers into the Association’s bargaining unit from another bargaining unit inside of the Agency or from another executive branch state Agency in the same salary range, will retain his/her base salary rate and salary eligibility date. However, where the employee’s current base pay rate is below Step 1 of the Association’s bargaining unit base pay rate for the same salary range, the employee’s base pay rate will be moved to Step 1 of the same salary range. If an employee’s straight time pay rate is above the top step, the employee will be placed at the top step of the range.

B. If an employee’s base pay rate caused them to be placed off step in his/her classification’s salary range, then at their next salary eligibility date, if qualified, the employee shall be granted an annual step increase of one full step plus the dollar amount that his/her current salary is below the next higher pay rate not to exceed the top step of the range.

### Section 5 - Salary on Promotion

An employee shall be given an increase to the next higher rate in the new salary range effective on the date of the promotion and the employee’s salary eligibility date shall be set for six \(6\) calendar months after the date of promotion or upon completion of trial service whichever is sooner. Upon successful completion of promotional trial service, the employee will receive a salary increase and annually thereafter until the employee reaches the top of the range.

### Section 6 - Salary on Demotion

Whenever an employee demotes to a job classification in a lower range that has a salary rate the same as the previous step, the employee's salary shall be maintained at the step in the lower range.

Whenever an employee demotes to a job classification in a salary range which does not have salary steps corresponding with the employee's previous salary but is within the new salary range, the employee's salary shall be maintained at the current rate until the next salary eligibility date. At the employee's next salary eligibility date, if qualified, the employee shall be granted a salary rate increase of one \(1\) full step within the new salary range, plus that amount that their current salary is below the next higher rate in the salary range. This increase shall not exceed the highest rate in the new salary range.

Whenever employees demote to a job classification in a lower range but their previous salary is above the highest step for that range, the employee shall be paid at the highest step in the new salary range.

This Section shall not apply to demotions resulting from official disciplinary actions.

### Section 7 - Effect of Break in Service

When an employee separates from State service and subsequently returns to the State service \(except as a temporary employee\) the employee's salary eligibility date shall be determined by the Employer as follows:

A. Return from Layoff List. When a former employee who was laid off and is recalled, the employee will be paid at the step the employee was at, at the time of layoff. The employee's previous salary eligibility date adjusted by the amount of break in service shall be restored.

B. Return from Reemployment. When a former employee is reemployed to a position in the same class in which the employee was previously employed or in a related class with the same salary range, the employee may be paid at or below the step at which he/she was being paid at the time of the employee's termination. If a person is reemployed in a position in a class with a lower salary range than that of the employee's previous position, the employee may be paid at any step in the lower salary range not exceeding the rate the employee was being paid in the higher salary range, except where exceptional circumstances justify payment of a higher rate. The previous salary eligibility date adjusted by the amount of break in service shall represent the salary eligibility date following return

### Section 8 - Recoupment of Salary/Benefits Overpayments

In the event that an employee receives wages from the Agency to which the employee is not entitled, regardless of whether the employee knew or should have known of the overpayment, the Agency shall notify the employee in writing of the overpayment which will include information supporting that an overpayment exists and the amount of wages and/or benefits to be repaid. Agency calculations of overpayments for a particular pay month will be based on the pay status after the final payroll run reconciles all hours for that month, including all holiday, shift differential, overtime, leave without pay, paid time off and regular hours etc., which have occurred during that month. For purposes of recovering overpayments by payroll deduction, the following shall apply:

a. Within fifteen \(15\) calendar days following written notification, the Agency, Association and employee shall attempt to reach agreement as to a mutually agreeable repayment schedule. The repayments will occur from the employee’s first \(1st\) of the month paychecks only unless the employee agrees to mid-month repayments. If they are unable to reach agreement on a repayment schedule, each side’s last offer shall be presented to an arbitrator, who shall select one.

b. In the event the employee was paid for hours not worked due to leave without pay, subsection \(a\) shall not apply and the overpayment is subject to immediate recoupment. The Agency shall send a letter by regular mail to the home of the affected employee and email whenever an immediate recoupment is triggered. In the case of SAIF leave without pay, the Agency shall also call the employee.

The Agency shall not attempt to correct any overpayment to employees more than twenty-four \(24\) months from the date upon which the oversight or error is discovered.

### Section 9

Overtime, holiday and all differentials may be paid on the fifteenth \(15th\) of the month at the employee’s option. Once an employee designates they want to have overtime, holiday and differentials paid on the fifteenth \(15th\) of each month, the designation will continue for twelve \(12\) consecutive calendar months without change. The employee will follow all processes necessary to ensure his/her request is properly implemented.

### Section 10 - Salary Underpayments

A. In the event the Agency determines an employee has not received wages/benefits to which he/she is lawfully entitled pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act or state law, the Agency shall pay the employee within three \(3\) working days the amount of money the employee is owed if such underpayment is equal to or more than five percent \(5%\) of the employee’s base pay rate.

B. In the event the Agency determines an employee has not received wages/benefits to which he/she is lawfully entitled, the Agency shall pay the employee at the next first \(1st\) of the month payday the amount of money the employee is owed if such underpayment is less than five percent \(5%\) of the employee’s base pay rate. If the Agency determines there is an underpayment obligation after the normal payroll cutoff date and before the mid month cutoff date, the Agency shall pay the employee on the mid month check.

C. This Section shall not apply to claims disputing eligibility for payments which result from this Agreement. Employees claiming eligibility for leadwork differential, work out of classification, reclassification or any differential pay shall pursue those claims pursuant to Article 44 - Grievance Procedure.

Overtime for employees working an irregular work schedule \(4-10\) is time worked in excess of the scheduled hours per day or forty \(40\) hours per week within the employee's basic workweek. Time worked beyond regular schedule by employees scheduled for less than eight \(8\) hours per day or forty \(40\) hours per week is additional straight time worked rather than overtime until work exceeds eight \(8\) hours per day or forty \(40\) hours per week within the employee's basic workweek. Overtime for employees working twelve \(12\)-hour shifts is time worked in excess of twelve \(12\) hours per day or the regularly-scheduled hours within the employee’s basic workweek.

B. Except for shift changes requested by the employee, weeks in which training occurs, or for trial service employees, if a shift change requires that an employee work more than five \(5\) consecutive days, he/she will be compensated at the rate of time and one-half \(1-1/2\) for all hours worked in excess of forty \(40\) hours within his/her prior workweek.

C. If an employee is required to work more than eight \(8\), ten \(10\), or twelve \(12\) hours \(depending on the employee’s assigned schedule\), in any twenty four \(24\) hour period, he/she shall be paid at the overtime rate for all hours in excess of the eight \(8\), ten \(10\), or twelve \(12\) hours during that same twenty-four \(24\)-hour period.

D. Employee's workweek is defined as the seven \(7\) day period beginning with his/her first scheduled workday.

### Section 3

Overtime shall be paid at the rate of time and one-half \(1-1/2\). The form of compensation of overtime shall be pay or compensatory time off, at the option of the Employer. If the compensatory time is used, it shall be credited at the appropriate overtime rate.

For security staff at SFFC and Corrections Professionals at all institutions, compensatory time accrued in excess of one hundred \(100\) hours will be paid off within the pay period of the month following the month in which it is accrued. If these excess hours are not paid by the Employer, the employee may transfer them to the employee's regular vacation leave bank.

### Section 4

No application of this Article shall be construed or interpreted to provide the compensation for overtime at a rate exceeding time and one-half \(1-1/2\), or to effect a "pyramiding" of overtime, i.e., time and one-half \(1-1/2\), except as provided herein.

### Section 5

Any employee assigned to escort inmates out of state will be compensated eight \(8\) hours a day at the straight time rate and one and one-half \(1-1/2\) times the straight time rate for any hours actually worked over eight \(8\) hours per day, unless escorting on their regular day off, where the employee shall receive overtime for the first eight \(8\) hours also.

### Section 6 - Voluntary Overtime Assignment

#### A. Custody Voluntary Overtime Procedures

OSP Employees are encouraged to sign up for voluntary overtime in advance of its occurrence to facilitate planning. The Employer will maintain voluntary overtime lists upon which employees may designate their eligibility in writing. Employees will indicate if they are available to volunteer for overtime during the period\(s\) covered by the voluntary overtime list\(s\). Employees may also indicate which days and shifts they will be available to work during the period\(s\) covered by the voluntary overtime list\(s\). The Employer may begin assigning people post qualified to work weekend overtime assignments for the laundry and for perimeter checks from the voluntary list two \(2\) to three \(3\) workdays prior to the shift being assigned. Employees may continue to sign up for overtime after this time, but may not displace an assignment once it is made. If the Employer determines there is a need for overtime less than twelve \(12\) hours in advance of the overtime opportunity, the overtime will be first offered to the employee who is on duty and whose assignment will be vacant at the conclusion of the shift. If that employee is not interested in the overtime, or if there is a valid reason for denial of the opportunity to that employee, then the Employer will make the overtime opportunity available to other post qualified employees who signed the voluntary overtime list, at the time the overtime is being assigned, beginning with those in the same classification by seniority, and then in seniority order to others on the voluntary overtime list who are outside the classification but are qualified to do the work. For the purposes of this sentence Correctional Officer overtime will be offered first to Correctional Officers, and if no volunteers then to Corporals and if no volunteers then to Sergeants; Corporal overtime first to Corporals and if no volunteers then to Correctional Officers, and if no volunteers then to Sergeants; Sergeant overtime first to Sergeants, and if no volunteers then to Corporals, and if no volunteers then to Correctional Officers.

Alternative time lines for tallying the volunteer overtime list of a particular corrections professionals work group may be agreed upon in writing by the parties to the agreement.

#### MCCF:

MCCF will follow the OSP procedure for assignment of voluntary overtime. Additionally, employees may “split” overtime. The employee assigned the overtime must work a minimum of the first half of the overtime assignment and will be responsible for coverage of the entire overtime assignment. The employee may choose to split any amount of the remainder of the overtime assignment with any other post qualified employee. The employee will be responsible for notifying the Officer in Charge of the intent to split the overtime and indicate the name of the employee that will be filling the remainder of the overtime assignment.

#### OSCI:

Overtime will be hired twenty-four \(24\) hours in advance for open posts in the Daily Roster only. Once an employee signs up for voluntary overtime twenty-four \(24\) hours out, that employee can not take another overtime opportunity on that shift and day unless the overtime they originally accepted was cancelled by management. Management will fill these overtime assignments according to Section 6\(A\)\(OSP\) above to include incumbency processes as defined for those overtime assignments that occur less than twelve \(12\) hours prior to the scheduled shift. Incumbency processes do not apply to overtime assignments filled more than twelve \(12\) hours in advance.

#### SFFC:

SFFC will assign voluntary overtime as follows:

1. If the Agency determines there is a need for overtime up to seven \(7\) days in advance of the overtime opportunity, the voluntary overtime list will be used to fill the overtime opportunity.
2. If the Agency determines there is a need for overtime less than twelve \(12\) hours in advance of the overtime opportunity, the overtime will first be offered to staff on duty on the shift immediately before the overtime is needed. Overtime will be given to the most senior employee who is qualified to do the work. If no one on the shift accepts the overtime, then the voluntary overtime list will be used in the following manner:

a. The overtime opportunity will first be offered to those in the same classification by seniority, and then in seniority order to employees in other classifications who are qualified to do the work.

b. Correctional Officer overtime will first be offered to Correctional Officers. If no Officer volunteers then the overtime opportunity will be offered to Corporals. If no Corporals volunteer then the overtime opportunity will be offered to Sergeants. Corporal overtime will first be offered to Corporals, then to Officers and if no volunteers, then the overtime opportunity will be offered to Sergeants. Sergeant overtime will first be offered to Sergeants then to Corporals and if there are still no volunteers then to Officers.

B. If there are overtime opportunities for nurses, they will be offered first to staff nurses who are on the voluntary overtime list for that week, before those opportunities are offered to other DOC unrepresented nurses or contract nurses.

C. Corrections Professionals Bid Positions Voluntary Overtime Procedures.

1. If management determines there is a need for overtime immediately following the end of the scheduled shift, it will first be offered to the employee who is working that job as part of his/her regular assignment. If the employee is not able or unavailable to work the overtime then the overtime opportunity will be made available to employees who signed the voluntary overtime list, beginning with those in the same classification by seniority, and then in seniority order to those on the voluntary overtime list who are outside the classification, but are qualified to perform the work. A regular assignment is defined as a job specific assignment an employee is typically and routinely assigned during the normal working hours of operation.
2. If management determines there is a need for overtime work other than immediately following the end of a scheduled shift the overtime opportunity will be made available to employees who have placed their names on the voluntary overtime list. The employee with the most classification seniority and who is qualified to perform the work required shall be offered the assignment. If that employee turns down the overtime assignment, the next employee with the highest classification seniority who is qualified to perform the work shall be offered the assignment.
3. If an employee volunteers through the procedures above for at least four \(4\) hours of overtime, the employee’s name will be placed on the bottom of the mandatory overtime list.

D. Physical Plant Trades Voluntary Overtime Procedure. If management determines there is a need for overtime work other than immediately following the end of a scheduled shift in the physical plant, the following procedure shall be used to fill the overtime work available:

1. Where work to be performed requires licensure/certification \(electrician, plumber, HVAC, PEST\), the overtime opportunity will be offered to the employees holding the license, based

on seniority. For example, an overtime opportunity for an electrician will be offered to employees in the electrician classification, based on classification seniority.

1. For journey level trades \(this includes carpenter, painter, welder 2\), the overtime opportunity will first be offered to the employee assigned to the needed classification. If that employee is unavailable or declines the overtime opportunity, the overtime will be offered to employees in the FMS classification based on classification seniority.
2. For general maintenance overtime work, the overtime will first be offered to employees in the FMS classification who are on the voluntary overtime list based on classification seniority. If the overtime opportunity is not filled using this method, then the overtime will be offered to employees on the voluntary overtime list based on DOC seniority regardless of classification.
3. If there is an overtime opportunity in the physical plant at SFFC involving electrical systems or components the overtime will be offered first to the SFFC flex schedule Electrician.

If the SFFC flex schedule Electrician is unavailable or declines the overtime, the overtime will be offered to the following individuals, in the following order: the Supervising Electrician at OSP, the Journeyman Electrician at OSP, and the Facility Energy Technicians at OSP.

E. Corrections Professionals Non-Bid Overtime Procedures. If management determines there is a need for overtime work, the overtime work will be offered to the employee performing the assigned duties. If that employee is not available or declines the overtime opportunity, the overtime will be offered to other employees in that classification in the work section based on classification seniority. In the event the Institution must fill a voluntary overtime assignment from outside the work section, Institution management will consult with the Association President or designee.

F. Employees must be qualified to perform the overtime work. For corrections professionals employees, this means that they have to have the skill to supervise work that is being performed by inmates, and for correctional officer series employees, they have to have either the experience or the ability to be able to perform the specialized security tasks.

G. If circumstances require a short extension of the shift to complete a task, the Employer may involuntarily require the affected employee\(s\) to stay and finish the assignment. Such extensions shall not affect the employee’s placement on the mandatory overtime lists unless the employee is required to work more than one \(1\) hour.

### Section 7 - Mandatory Overtime

A. Bid Positions.Mandatory overtime is defined as any work beyond the employee’s regular shift, other than short extensions of the shift to complete a task where such extension are one \(1\) hour or less in length, and the employee could face potential discipline if they leave their work site. When an overtime opportunity arises and management is unable to find a volunteer to fill that assignment, the Employer may assign employees for the overtime opportunity from a mandatory overtime list on a rotating basis, based on inverse classification seniority. For the purpose of mandatory overtime, RN’s and HST’s shall be considered one \(1\) classification. For the purpose of mandatory overtime, Sergeants, Corporals, and Correctional Officers shall be considered one \(1\) classification. Staff will not be required to work mandatory overtime on their Fridays, their scheduled days off, or if they have already worked an overtime assignment on that day except during periods of declared emergency. Staff may agree to work mandatory overtime on their Friday.

Custody staff who work a voluntary overtime shift of four \(4\) hours or more shall move to the bottom of the mandatory overtime list.

#### SFFC \(Custody\):

1. If no employee volunteers for an overtime opportunity, the Institution will use the Mandatory Overtime List. This list will be supplied by the AOCE South Fork Vice President and will be updated in writing every ninety \(90\) calendar days. This list will be in inverse order of bargaining unit seniority. When a staff member is called and works the overtime they will be moved to the bottom of the list. Staff who work a voluntary overtime shift shall move to the bottom of the mandatory overtime list.
2. The Institution shall not be liable for any mistakes in the calculation of bargaining unit seniority.

Nurses shall continue to be assigned pre-scheduled mandatory overtime fourteen \(14\) days in advance.

### Section 8 - Food Service Coordinator Overtime

A. If management determines there is a need for overtime assignment the Agency will use the voluntary overtime procedures outlined in Article 12 Section 6\(C\) using Food Service Coordinator staff.

B. When management is unable to find a volunteer to fill an overtime assignment at MCCF, the Agency will use the voluntary overtime procedures outlined in Article 12, Section 6\(c\) using the voluntary overtime list for FSC’s at OSP.

C. If the Agency is not able to find a volunteer to work an overtime assignment, the Agency will use the mandatory overtime procedures outlined in Article 12 Section 7\(A\) of the agreement at the institution with the vacancy.

Lead work is where, on a recurring daily basis, while performing essentially the same duties as the workers led, the employee has been directed to perform substantially all of the following functions: to orient new employees, if appropriate; assign and reassign tasks to accomplish prescribed work efficiently; give direction to workers concerning work procedures; transmit established standards of performance to workers; review work of employees for conformance to standards; and provide informal assessment of workers' performance to the supervisor. All lead work assignments exceeding one \(1\) calendar work day shall be in writing delivered to the affected employee at the time the assignment is made.

### Section 2

The differential shall be five percent \(5%\) beginning from the first day the duties were formally assigned in writing for the full period of the assignment.

### Section 3

Lead work differential shall not be computed at the rate of time and one-half \(1-1/2\) for the time worked in an overtime or holiday work situation, or to effect a "pyramiding" of work out of classification payment.

### Section 4

Lead work differential shall not apply for voluntary training and development purposes which are mutually agreed to in writing between the supervisor and the employee.

### Section 5

If an employee believes that he/she is performing the duties that meet the criteria in Section 1 of a lead worker but the duties have not been formally assigned in writing, the employee may notify the Functional Unit Manager in writing. The Agency will review the duties within fifteen \(15\) calendar days of the notification. If the Agency determines that lead work duties were in fact assigned and are appropriate, the lead work differential will be effective beginning with the day the employee notified the Agency Head of the issue.

If the Agency determines that the lead work duties were in fact assigned but should not be continued, the Agency may remove the duties during the fifteen \(15\) calendar day review period with no penalty, except for payment of lead work differential for the time actually worked.

If the Agency concludes that the duties are not lead work, the Agency shall notify the employee in writing within fifteen \(15\) calendar days from receipt of the employee's notification to the Functional Unit Manager.
