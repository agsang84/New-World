# AOCE Articles 41 - 44

## ARTICLE 41 - EMPLOYEE RIGHTS

Both parties recognize that it is important to investigate allegations of misconduct to protect the Employer from claims of liability and to clear the good name of the employee. Both sides recognize that any investigation through a formal internal affairs investigation or informally by a supervisor is a very stressful process. Therefore, the Employer promises that these investigations will take place in the most professional manner as possible and that interviews shall be done under circumstances devoid of intimidation, abuse, or coercion. The Association pledges it will urge employees to cooperate fully with any investigation to allegations of misconduct. In order to accomplish these goals, the parties have agreed to the following procedures:

### Section 1

Any employee who will be interviewed concerning an act, which, if proven, could reasonably result in disciplinary action against him or her will be afforded the following safeguards:

The employee will be informed prior to the interview if the Employer believes the employee is a subject in the investigation.

At least twenty-four \(24\) hours prior to any interview with the employee where the Employer may impose an economic sanction, such as suspension, salary reduction, demotion, or dismissal upon the employee as a result of the underlying incident, the employee will be provided written notice of the nature of the investigation and of facts reasonably sufficient to inform the employee of the circumstances surrounding the allegations under investigation known at the time and informed of and afforded the opportunity to consult with an Association representative. If after the complainant is interviewed regarding an action or inaction of an employee, and further investigation is deemed necessary, the employee shall be notified in writing of the complaint as soon as is practical. The requirement will not apply where the employee is under investigation for violations of the Controlled Substances Act, or violations which are punishable as felonies or misdemeanors under Oregon Law. Also the employee will not be notified if doing so would jeopardize either the criminal or administrative investigation. The employee shall be allowed the right to have an Association representative present during the interview. The opportunity to consult with the Association representative or to have the Association representative present at the interview shall not delay the interview more than two \(2\) hours except for minor complaints \(incidents for which discipline no greater than a written reprimand may result\) which may be handled immediately when a representative is not readily available. However, if in the course of the interview, it appears as if a more serious disciplinary problem has developed, the employee will be allowed up to two \(2\) hours to obtain a representative to assist him or her in the interview.

Interviews shall take place at Department facilities or worksites, or elsewhere if mutually agreed, unless an emergency exists which requires the interview to be conducted elsewhere. Telephone interviews may occur where mutually agreed.

The Agency shall make a reasonable good faith effort to conduct these interviews during the employee’s regularly scheduled shift, except for emergencies. Where an employee is working on a graveyard shift, the interview can be scheduled contiguously to the employee’s shift so long as appropriate overtime or irregular hour’s payments are made.

The employee will be required to answer any questions involving non-criminal matters under investigation and will be afforded all rights and privileges to which the employee is entitled under the laws of the State of Oregon or the United States.

Investigatory interviews will be held in a professional and mutually respectful manner. During interviews Employees shall upon request be allowed a reasonable break to use the rest room facilities; and, following each successive period of three \(3\) hours of interview, employees shall be permitted at least a ten \(10\) minute rest break, during which employees shall remain in a designated area, and refrain from discussing the interview with any persons save the assigned interviewers.

In the absence of recorded material from either the Employer or Association, the employee will be given a copy of any written statement or report describing the employee’s statements. In the event of a subsequent interview in the course of the same investigation, the written statement will be provided before the interview.

### Section 2

If the Department, Association, or employee tape records of the interview, a copy of the complete interview of the employee, noting all recess periods, shall be furnished upon request, to all parties. If the interviewed employee is subsequently charged and any part of the recording is transcribed by the Employer, the employee shall be given a complimentary copy thereof.

All interviews shall be limited in scope to activities, circumstances, events, conduct or acts which pertain to the incident which is the subject of the investigation. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the Employer from questioning the employee about information which is developed during the course of the interview.

### Section 3

A. The employee shall be notified of the outcome of the investigation within a timely manner after the investigation has been completed.

B. Except for conditions outlined in the subsection \(C\) of this section, investigations involving an employee that may lead to a suspension without pay, pay reduction, demotion or dismissal will be completed no later than six \(6\) calendar months starting from the first interview date. However, the Employer may extend the investigation to a maximum of twelve \(12\) calendar months from the first interview date provided the Employer gives written notice to the Association and employee, explaining the reason for the extension.

C. The time limits provided in subsection \(B\) of this section shall not apply when any one \(1\) of the following occurs:

1. the employee is incapacitated or unavailable; 
2. the investigation involves an allegation of workers compensation or disability fraud; 
3. the Association or employee waives the timelines in writing; 
4. the investigation involves more than one \(1\) employee; 
5. the investigation is conducted by an outside law enforcement agency;
6. the investigation involves a criminal matter;
7. the investigation requires coordination with another law enforcement agency; 
8. if the alleged misconduct is also subject of a criminal investigation or criminal prosecution; or 
9. if the investigation is a result of a complaint by a person charged with a crime.

D. The Employer may reopen an investigation if significant new evidence is discovered that is likely to affect the outcome of the investigation and 1\) the evidence was obtained from the employee’s pre-disciplinary response; or 2\) the evidence could not have been discovered by the Employer without resorting to extraordinary measures. 

E. The public safety officer may record the interview and must be given a copy of the tape or digital file of the interview and, upon request, a transcript of any recording that has been transcribed by the Agency. 

F. The public safety officer must be given a copy of any written statement or report describing the officer’s statements. 

G. Materials required to be given to the public safety officer under \(E\) and \(F\) above must be given before subsequent interviews in the course of the same investigation. 

H. As soon as it is determined that the public safety officer may be charged with a criminal offense, the officer must be informed of the officer’s right to consult with a criminal defense counsel with respect to the criminal charge. 

I. In a disciplinary or administrative investigation, the public safety officer’s chosen representative may not be required to disclose, or be subject to disciplinary action for refusing to disclose, statements made by the employee to the representative for purposes of representation.

### Section 4

In the case of a pre-termination or pre-disciplinary \(economic\) due process hearing, the Employer shall provide the employee who has completed initial trial service a fourteen \(14\)-day notice, except the fourteen \(14\)-day notice may be waived by mutual agreement between the Association President or the President’s designee and the Employer. Concurrent with the notification of the hearing, the Employer shall provide copies of all transcripts, tapes, files, and other materials on which the Employer is basing the discipline. Any confidentiality issues regarding this documentation shall be settled prior to the notification. The Association will make every effort to make one comprehensive request for any items it believes is necessary for purposes of representation.

### Section 5

The Employer agrees not to use non-verified or non-sustained charges against the employee nor place those matters in the employee's personnel file. 

### Section 6

The employee shall not be required to take or be subjected to any lie detector device as a condition of continued employment.

### Section 7 - Withdrawal of Resignation

An employee who has given written notice of resignation has up to forty-eight \(48\) clock hours during which to rescind the resignation. Beyond the forty-eight \(48\) hour period, the resignation may be withdrawn only with the approval of the Appointing Authority. 

### Section 8 - Administrative Leave/Duty Stationed at Home

Employees placed on paid administrative leave/duty stationed at home shall be provided a written notice with the reasons for the leave.

## ARTICLE 42 – DRUG TESTING

### Section 1 - Policy

The Department of Corrections considers its employees to be its most valuable asset and is concerned about their safety, health and well-being. The misuse of alcohol and other drugs can impair employee performance and general physical and mental health, and may jeopardize the safety of co-workers and the general public. The DOC is committed to maintaining a safe and healthy work place for all employees by identifying the misuse of alcohol and drugs and assisting employees to overcome these problems through appropriate treatment and, if necessary, disciplinary action. The presence or treatment of a substance use problem will not excuse an employee from meeting performance, safety or attendance standards or following other DOC instructions.

### Section 2 - Baseline Testing

Those employees who are or may be exposed to hazardous substances or health hazards, including dangerous drugs or dangerous chemicals used for the manufacture of drugs, at or above permissible exposure limits \(as defined by OSHA regulations\) in the course and scope of their employment shall be tested by the Agency for exposure to the hazardous substance as follows:

A. Baseline drug test prior to assignment to an area where employees will be or may be exposed to hazardous substances or health hazards. 

B. At least once every twelve \(12\) months thereafter unless the employee’s attending physician believes a longer interval is appropriate, but not to exceed biannual exams. 

C. At termination or reassignment to an area where exposure will not occur if the employee has not had an examination within the preceding six \(6\) months. 

D. As soon as possible after notification that signs or symptoms indicating possible overexposure have developed or, an injury has occurred, or exposure above the permissible exposure limits or published exposure levels has occurred in an emergency situation, and

E. Where the employee’s attending physician determines that examinations on a basis more frequently than that outlined above are medically necessary. **The test will be done at Agency’s expense and on Agency time.**

### Section 3 - Prohibited Conduct

The following conduct is prohibited:

A. The buying, selling, or providing; or possession for the purpose of buying, selling, or providing controlled substances including marijuana while on Agency property or in Agency vehicles or equipment, or during work hours, including paid rest and meal periods. 

B. Being at work under the influence of alcoholic intoxicants, or consuming alcoholic intoxicants while in Agency vehicles or equipment at any time, or on Agency property during work hours, including paid rest and meal periods.

C. Being at work with a blood alcohol content that reaches or exceeds .02% by weight of alcohol in the blood. 

D. Possession of any controlled substance including marijuana \(but excluding any substance lawfully prescribed for the employee’s use which has not been obtained for the purpose of abuse\) while on Agency property, or Agency vehicles or equipment at any time, during work hours, including paid rest and meal periods. However, this excludes substances that have been legally prescribed for an employee’s own use. 

E. Being at work under the influence of any controlled substance, including marijuana, or having such substances “present in the body” \(excluding any substance lawfully prescribed for the employee’s own use which has not been obtained for the purpose of abuse\) while on Agency property, or Agency vehicles or equipment at any time, during work hours, including paid rest and meal periods. An employee has a controlled substance “present in the body” when the employee tests “positive” in any blood or urine test administered. An employee shall be deemed to test “positive” for cannabinoids \(marijuana or hashish\) if his or her urine test indicates 50 or more nanograms THC metabolites/ml. However, this excludes substances that have been prescribed for employee’s own use. 

F. Abusing any substance which is lawfully prescribed by regularly taking it in excessive quantities or by unlawfully obtaining it for purposes of abuse. 

G. For purposes of this Article, the term “controlled substance” shall be defined in accordance with ORS 475.005\(6\).

### Section 4 - Under the Influence

The term “under the influence” of controlled substances including marijuana or alcoholic intoxicants covers not only all the well-known and easily recognized conditions and degrees of impairment and intoxication, but any perceptible abnormal mental or physical condition which is the result of indulging to any degree in controlled substances, marijuana or alcoholic intoxicants which perceptibly tend to deprive the use of that clearness of intellect and control the employee would otherwise possess. 

### Section 5 - Discipline and Other Action

Prohibited conduct described in Section 3A, 3D, and 3E above shall result in termination. Prohibited conduct described in Sections 3B, 3C and 3F shall result in actions specified in Section 7 below. 

### Section 6

 In the event that the Agency wishes to call out an employee to perform additional duties and the employee has consumed intoxicants, the employee will notify his or her supervisor as to the amount of intoxicants the employee has consumed, and the Agency will decide whether the employee will be called out to perform additional duties.

### Section 7 - Mandatory Testing

A. Where the Agency has a reasonable suspicion that an employee is under the influence of any alcoholic intoxicants or controlled substances, including marijuana, or has a controlled substance, including marijuana, present in the body, the Agency may require that the employee immediately consent and submit to field impairment tests, blood, urine or breathalyzer test. The Agency shall pay for the costs of the tests. A refusal to consent and submit to any of these tests shall subject an employee to immediate termination. 

B. When the employee is notified that he or she is required to consent and submit to such tests, or searches as described in Section 10 of this Article, he or she may request the presence of an Association representative to witness the tests or searches. The test or searches may not be unduly delayed in order to wait for a representative. The absence of a representative shall not be grounds for the employee to refuse to consent and submit to such tests or searches. The presence of a representative shall not disrupt or interfere with the tests or searches. 

C. Before a supervisor, acting on the behalf of the Agency under this policy, may require an employee to consent and submit to any test\(s\) specified in this section, the supervisor must first obtain concurrence from the supervisor’s department head or his designee that the information available to the Agency about the subject employee is sufficient to determine reasonable suspicion that prohibited conduct will be established as a result of such test\(s\). 

D. The employee shall give consent to a blood, urine, or breathalyzer test by signing a consent form. The form shall contain the following information: 

1. Employee’s consent to release test results to the Agency; 
2. The procedure for confirming an initial positive test result for a controlled substance, including marijuana; 
3. The consequences of a confirmed positive test result for a controlled substance, including marijuana; 

4. The consequences of a positive test for alcohol, including one at or above .02%; 

5. A listing provided by the employee of legally prescribed and over-the-counter medications which may be in the employee’s body; 

6. The right to explain a confirmed positive test result for a controlled substance, including marijuana, or a positive test for alcohol; 

7. The consequence of refusing to consent to the blood, urine or breathalyzer test.

E. After the sample is given, the contractor will divide the sample into two \(2\) parts. Each of the two \(2\) portions of the sample will be separately sealed, labeled, and appropriately stored by the contractor. One of the samples will be tested by a lab designated by the Employer. The other sample will be held by the lab. 

F. In the event that the blood or urine test results are positive for controlled substance\(s\), including marijuana, the Agency shall require that a second confirmatory test from the same sample be conducted, using gas chromatography mass spectrograph techniques or equivalent, which also must be positive before concluding the employee has such substance\(s\) present in their body. 

G. The following are the established cut off levels for a positive test:

| **Screening Test** |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Marijuana | 50 ng/ml |
| Cocaine | 300 ng/ml |
| Opiates | 300 ng/ml |
| Phencyclidine | 25 ng/ml |
| Amphetamines | 1000 ng/ml |
| Barbiturates  | 300 ng/ml |
| Benzpdiazepine  | 300 ng/ml  |
| Quaaludes \(Methaqualine\) | 300 ng/ml |

| **Confirmatory Test** |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Marijuana | 15 ng/ml |
| Cocaine | 150 ng/ml |
| Opiates | 300 ng/ml |
| Phencyclidine | 25 ng/ml |
| Amphetamines | 500 ng/ml |
| Barbiturates  | 200 ng/ml |
| Benzpdiazepine  | 200 ng/ml  |
| Quaaludes \(Methaqualine\) | 200 ng/ml |

The threshold levels for positive screening and confirmatory test results will be consistent with the Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Drug Testing Programs and are subject to immediate change by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Such changes will be reflected as immediate amendments to the contract.

H. If a blood or confirmed urine test is positive, the Agency will instruct the laboratory to retain the blood or urine sample for a period of not less than thirty \(30\) calendar days from the date the tests are complete for the purpose of allowing the employee to conduct an independent test at his or her own expense at a laboratory approved by the Agency. 

I. The procedure followed under this Article to obtain, handle and store blood and urine samples and to conduct laboratory tests shall be documented to establish procedural integrity and chain of evidence. Such procedures shall be administered with due regard for the employee’s privacy and the need to maintain the confidentiality of the test results to an extent which is not inconsistent with the needs of the policy. The employee shall be notified of the results of all tests conducted pursuant to this policy.

### Section 8 - Consequences of Test Results

A. Test results which do not positively establish that the employee has engaged in prohibited conduct as described in Sections 3B, 3C or 3F of this Article shall result in no further action against the employee related to an alleged violation of those sections. The employee shall be informed of such test results. 

B. If an employee who has not previously committed prohibited conduct specified in Sections 3B, 3C or 3F, the employee shall immediately submit to a medical evaluation by a doctor selected and paid by the agency. The evaluation will determine the extent of the employee’s use of, and dependence on, the applicable substance\(s\) and, if necessary, recommend an appropriate program of treatment, including but not limited to rehabilitation and counseling to prevent future use. If a program of treatment is recommended by the doctor, the employee shall enroll in it immediately. Failure by the employee to enroll in the recommended program or to complete it successfully shall result in his or her termination from employment.

C. If an employee has previously committed prohibited conduct specified in Sections 3B, 3C or 3F, and subsequently is found to have committed such prohibited conduct a second time within three \(3\) years, he or she shall be terminated. The level of discipline imposed for subsequent instances of such prohibited conduct beyond three \(3\) years may be termination but shall be determined on a case by case basis.

### Section 9 - Voluntary Rehabilitation

A. The primary objectives of the Agency’s drug and alcohol policy are to maintain employee performance and good health and a safe work environment. If, prior to a requirement by the Agency that the employee submit to any of the tests specified in Section 7 of this Article, the employee notifies a supervisor that he or she has drug or alcohol problems that require treatment, then in that event the employee shall immediately submit to a medical evaluation by a doctor selected and paid by the Agency and shall enroll in a treatment program recommended by the doctor.

B. If an employee has previously enrolled in a voluntary rehabilitative treatment described in sub-section A and subsequently again volunteers for such treatment in advance of being required to submit to any of the tests specific in Section 7 of this Article, then the employee shall immediately submit to a medical evaluation by a doctor selected and paid by the Agency and shall successfully complete the treatment program recommended by the doctor. If the employee fails to complete the treatment program successfully he or she shall be terminated.

### Section 10 - Searches

The Agency reserves the right to conduct searches for any reason of Agency equipment or facilities generally; and may search anything or area in which the employee has an expectation of privacy \(i.e., desk or locker or clothing or personal property\) to the extent permitted by the law. Refusal by the employee to submit to a lawful search shall result in termination.

### Section 11 - Consequences of Search Results

A. Searches which do not reveal the presence of alcohol or controlled substances, including marijuana \(but excluding any substance lawfully prescribed for the employee’s use which has not been obtained for the purpose of abuse\), shall result in no further action against the employee related to an alleged violation of Section 3D. The employee shall be informed of such search results. 

B. Searches which reveal the presence of alcohol or controlled substances, including marijuana \(but excluding any substance lawfully prescribed for the employee’s use which has not been obtained for the purpose of abuse\), shall result in those consequences specified in Section 5 and Sections 8B and 8C as though a positive blood or confirmed urine test had been administered. 

### Section 12 - Supervisor Training

The Agency recognizes that, in order to administer the standards and procedures set forth in this Article fairly and to minimize the possibility of unwarranted testing and searches, supervisory personnel should receive training in how to recognize and deal effectively with substance abuse in the work place. Accordingly, the Agency will provide such training to supervisors. Supervisors enforce the requirements of this Article. 

## ARTICLE 43 - DISCIPLINE AND DISCHARGE 

### Section 1

No employee who has completed the initial trial service period shall be disciplined, dismissed or denied a salary step without just cause.

### Section 2

#### A. Dismissal Appeal

The dismissal \(and pre-dismissal suspension without pay\) of a regular status employee may be appealed by the Association to binding arbitration. The appeal must state the reasons for the appeal and be submitted to the Labor Relations Unit in writing within ten \(10\) calendar days from the effective date of the dismissal. The Association may within the same ten \(10\) days request arbitration. The process for arbitration shall be governed by Article 44, Sections 4, 5 and 6. 

#### B. Appeal of Discipline Other than Dismissal

An employee shall receive written notice of the discipline with the specific charges and facts supporting the discipline. Appeal of a written reprimand, a salary step withheld based on just cause and discipline other than dismissal shall be in accordance with Article 44, Grievance and Arbitration Procedure beginning at Step 2.

### Section 3

In the event of reduction in pay, dismissal, suspension, demotion or written reprimand, a written statement shall be given to the employee at the time action is taken. In the event it is necessary to immediately remove the employee from the premises, the written statement shall be provided within forty-eight \(48\) hours of the removal. The written statement shall include the complaint against the employee and the facts upon which the Employer relies in support of the complaint. 

### Section 4

A pre-disciplinary investigation shall be conducted with regard to a regular status employee against whom a charge is presented which potentially justifies discipline above a written reprimand. The Appointing Authority or designee shall provide notification to such an employee and to the Association President of the following: the known complaints, facts and charges; and that the employee will be afforded the opportunity to refute such charges or present mitigating circumstances at an informal meeting at a time and date set forth in the notice. The employee may be suspended in accordance with current practice or be allowed to continue work during the period of investigation. The Appointing Authority will normally issue a final decision within twenty-one \(21\) calendar days after the meeting or will notify the employee and the Association within that time when the decision can be expected. Extensions requested by the employee or the Association shall not count against the twenty-one \(21\) days. 

### Section 5

Upon the request of any employee who is called to an investigatory meeting or a meeting which may result in discipline being imposed upon the employee, the employee shall be entitled to the presence of an Association representative. Should an employee be demoted or discharged by the Employer, an Association representative will be made aware of the action prior to the Employer talking to the employee and allowed to be present at the meeting. Should the employee not desire Association representation at the meeting, he/she may request the Association representative leave prior to the start of the meeting.

### Section 6

An Association representative shall have the right to discuss with appropriate management staff any disciplinary action imposed at the affected employee's written request with or without the employee's presence. 

> REV: 2017

## ARTICLE 44 - GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION 

### Section 1

Grievances are defined as acts, omissions, applications or interpretations alleged to be violations of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Employees are encouraged to resolve their problems informally at the immediate supervisor level. If their problems cannot be resolved, the employee may utilize the following procedure. A grievance shall not be expanded upon after the grievance has been filed at Step 2. 

### Section 2

Disputes arising from dismissal are subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure pursuant to the expedited procedures described in [**Article 43, Discipline and Discharge**](aoce-articles-41-44.md#article-43-discipline-and-discharge), Section 2\(A\). Section 3. Grievance Steps. 

#### Step 1

The employee, and/or the Association representative, will contact the supervisor at the next higher level within the same command structure to meet and discuss the alleged contract violations. 

#### Step 2

If the issue is unresolved following Step 1, the Association may submit a grievance in writing to the appropriate Functional Unit Manager within thirty \(30\) days of the alleged occurrence. The grievance will contain the date of occurrence, the act or omission that created the grievance, the Section\(s\) of the contract violated, and the remedy requested. A meeting will be held by the parties \(including the grievant if the grievant wishes to attend and the Functional Unit Manager or his/her designee\) to mutually share information about the grievance. The parties shall fully disclose their respective positions and supporting evidence. All potentials for settlement will be discussed in this forum and shall be non-prejudicial to the parties if arbitration occurs. This meeting shall occur and a response from the Functional Unit Manager shall be given within thirty \(30\) calendar days of the Association's appeal to Step 2, unless otherwise agreed to in writing. 

#### Step 3

If the grievance is not resolved at the appropriate Functional Unit Manager level the Association may request review of the grievance by the Labor Relations Administrator within fifteen \(15\) days after receiving the response from the Functional Unit Manager. A response from the Labor Relations Administrator or designee shall be given within twenty-one \(21\) calendar days of the Association’s appeal to Step 3, unless otherwise agreed to in writing.

#### Step 4

If the grievance is not resolved at the Labor Relations Administrator or designee level, the Association may request arbitration of the grievance within fifteen \(15\) days after receiving the response from the Labor Relations Administrator or designee. 

### Section 4 - Selection of an Arbitrator

A. Within fifteen \(15\) days after the response from the Assistant Director for Human Resources, the Association will request from the Employment Relations Board, with a copy to the Department of Administrative Services, Labor Relations Unit, the names of seven \(7\) qualified arbitrators. The copy to the Department of Administrative Services shall also include a copy of the grievance and all correspondence from earlier steps as well as AOCE contract information. Where the grievance concerns a disciplinary action, a copy of the disciplinary action shall also be enclosed. 

B. Prior to selecting an arbitrator for the grievance, the Association, DOC and DAS will meet to discuss the merits of the case and options for resolution. Such meeting will occur within thirty \(30\) days of the Section 4 - A "appeal". 

C. Within fifteen days \(15\) days of the Section 4.B meeting, the Association and the Employer will select an arbitrator by alternately striking names from the Employment Relations Board list until one \(1\) name remains on the list. Who strikes first will be determined by the flip of a coin. The last remaining name shall be accepted by the parties as the arbitrator. 

### Section 5

The parties agree that the decision or award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on each of the parties and that they will abide thereby. The parties do not waive any right of review provided by law. The arbitrator shall have no authority to add to or subtract from or change any of the terms of this Agreement. The arbitrator's award shall be due to the parties within thirty \(30\) days of the close of the hearing. 

### Section 6

The arbitrator's fees and expenses shall be paid by the losing party. If in the opinion of the arbitrator, neither party can be considered the losing party, then such expenses shall be apportioned as in the arbitrator's judgment as equitable. All other expenses shall be borne exclusively by the party requiring the service or item for which payment is made. 

### Section 7

Time limits specified in this procedure must be observed unless either party requests a specific extension of time which if agreed to shall be stipulated in writing and shall become part of the grievance record.

### Section 8

The grievant \(or a representative of the group in the case of a group grievance\) may attend meetings with management concerning his/her grievance on paid time; however, shall not receive overtime as a result of such meetings.
