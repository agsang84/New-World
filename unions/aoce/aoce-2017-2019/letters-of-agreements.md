The method of selecting employees and distributing fire camp, fire crew and other fire related assignments shall be worked out in an agreement between each local union and the management at each institution. If an agreement cannot be reached, the Agency will select from a list of qualified volunteers based upon bargaining unit seniority.

### Section 2

Fire camp and fire crew duties are voluntary assignments, and by the volunteering, the employees agree to deviate from normal work schedules without any shift changes penalty to the Agency. These assignments may include long hours in outdoor settings far from the employee’s designated institution.

### Section 3

Staffing requirements will vary depending upon the needs of the outside Agencies that contract with the Agency for fire related services.

Employees who are required to wear fire line Agency approved boots due to their assignment to a fire camp, shall purchase boots meeting applicable safety standards. Upon completion of fire season, employees shall receive one hundred fifty dollars \($150\) towards said purchase upon delivery of proof of purchase.

### Section 5

A fire assignment is defined as the time period from activation until the employee returns to their functional unit and completes assigned deactivation duties.

#### a\) Fire Assignment Work Schedule

Employees shall have a work schedule of sixteen \(16\) hours on and eight \(8\) hours off each day except on the day of deployment, the day demobilization and where authorized by the Agencies contract with the Oregon Department of Forestry.

#### b\) Length of Assignment

Standard assignment is up to fourteen \(14\) days or less exclusive of travel to and from the institution. Travel time to and from the incident shall be considered time worked. The length of the assignment is unknown at the time of the placement of the resource order and days and hours worked are not guaranteed. 

#### c\) Days Off

Employees returning from fire assignments that have worked less than seven \(7\) days total, but have worked more than twelve \(12\) consecutive hours on the day of their return, will have a minimum eight \(8\) hours of rest between their fire assignment and the beginning of their next regularly scheduled shift at the institution. Administrative leave will be provided to the employee for any portion of the eight \(8\) hour rest period that falls during the employee’s regular scheduled shift. Administrative Leave is not applicable for those employees not scheduled to work within the twenty-four \(24\) hour period upon their return.

Employees returning from fire assignments that have worked consecutively for seven \(7\) to thirteen \(13\) days will receive a twenty-four \(24\) hour rest period upon return to their functional unit and completion of deactivation duties. Administrative Leave will cover any portion of an employee’s remaining shift during this twenty-four \(24\) hour period. Upon written request and barring any compelling reason, employees may take accrued leave for time off beyond the twenty-four \(24\) hour rest period that would result in the completion of their next regularly scheduled work shift at the institution. Administrative Leave is not applicable for those employees not scheduled to work within the twenty-four \(24\) hour period upon their return.

Employees who have been on assignment fourteen \(14\) consecutive days or more, and who request it, will be permitted to utilize one \(1\) day of accrued vacation leave in addition to Administrate Leave before returning to their normal work schedule. 

#### d\) Extension of Agreement

Upon completion of the standard fourteen \(14\) day assignment, an employee may request an extension of up to seven \(7\) days if allowed by local labor / management agreement, and upon the approval of the Superintendent of his / her designee.

Assignment may be extended up to an additional seven \(7\) days beyond the twenty-one \(21\) day period by local labor / management agreement, at the request of the employee, and approval of the Superintendent of his / her designee.

Days off will be away from the fire camp with transportation provided back to the institution by the Agency. The decision where to take the mandatory days off will be made between the employee and the Superintended or his / her designee with the intention that the employee’s first \(1st\) option will be returning home.

### Section 6

When employees are deployed on fire assignment where inmates are provided meals, employees shall receive at least the same number of meals as the inmates, free of charge. After initial deployment, meals will be provided based upon resource orders from the Department of Forestry’s dispatching office to an institution or by way of agreement between the Department of Corrections and the Department of Forestry for the provision of these services.

In many situations, on call / standby pay will not be paid for off-duty time.

### Section 8

Notification of on call or off-duty status shall be provided for through the fire camp roster if such a roster exists: It shall be the responsibility of the employee to check the roster on a daily basis. If the fire camp does not have a daily roster or a camp commander, then the senior employee will make every reasonable effort to check with their respective institution fire camp manager / designee prior to assigning an employee to on call status.

### Section 9

On call time will be distributed evenly and equitably to employees regardless of bargaining unit.

### Section 10

Department employees may be permitted to utilize state-owned vehicles \(DOC or ODOF\) when available and to the extent that use does not compromise the operation of the fire camp or fire crews for use during non-work hours if such use is consistent with policies outlined by the Department of Administrative Services, the Department of Corrections or the Department of Forestry.

While performing fire camp duties, possession consumption or possession by consumption of alcohol while in fire camp or on the fire line is prohibited.

### Section 11

If an employee is off duty and not on call / standby, then that employee shall not be required to respond to work related situations, except in emergencies. Failure to respond to any such situations shall not be grounds for any disciplinary action, except in emergencies and then only in situations where discipline would be appropriate under Article 43 of the contract. If an employee is required to respond to an emergency or any other situation at the fire camp while off duty, the employee shall be entitled to call back / standby status pursuant to the contract.

### Section 12

All staff who are assigned to be deployed for fire season, including correctional officer series and food service staff, will be provided the two \(2\) hour basic wild fire training prior to deployment at fires. This training will be considered on-duty time.
