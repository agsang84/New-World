C. Each institution will schedule vacation bidding at their usual time.

D. During the annual vacation bid process, employees may place bids for as many one \(1\) week blocks of time as they desire. However, employees will not be allowed to bid for vacation slots if they will not have the necessary accrued hours at the time of the requested days off. Those blocks of time requested can be in non-consecutive weeks.

E. OSP, MCCF, SFFC and OSCI will each bid separately.

If two \(2\) or more employees, on the same day, request the same period of time and the matter cannot be resolved by agreement of the parties concerned, the employee having the greatest length of State service shall be granted the time; however, this tie breaking seniority may be exercised only once in any calendar year. An employee may not use his/her seniority to bump an employee out of their Section 10 bid vacation under this Section.

### Section 11

Employees' vacations will start the first \(1st\) day following their regularly scheduled days off when approved by the Agency. Security employee vacation block\(s\) of time will start on Sunday.

### Section 12

A. Staff will be given a specific time and date based upon DOC seniority in which to take place a vacation bid. The “window” will be thirty \(30\) minutes in length.

If an employee does not bid in their assigned “window” they may bid anytime afterwards during this process for those remaining open slots.

B. If an employee desires to turn in a vacation slot, management will open that vacancy to rebid the vacant slot unless there is a valid cause not to do so. The bid period shall be open for seven \(7\) calendar days. The slot will be awarded based on DOC seniority in the following order: first preference goes to employees who have not previously had the opportunity to exercise their seniority to obtain a vacation slot, then to all employees who request the slot. Employees who chose not to bid will be considered to have had the opportunity to exercise their seniority to obtain a vacation slot. Employees may only exercise their seniority under this section once per vacation bid cycle. If the slot is returned less than thirty \(30\) days prior to the date of the vacation slot, this time will be utilized for single days off subject to first-come, first-served basis.

## ARTICLE 22 - SICK LEAVE WITH PAY

### Section 1

Employees shall accrue eight \(8\) hours of sick leave for each full month worked. Employees working less than a full month, but at least thirty-two \(32\) hours shall accrue sick leave on a pro rata basis.

### Section 2

Employees who have been separated from the State Service and return as regular status within one \(1\) year shall have unused sick leave credits accrued during previous employment restored.

### Section 3

Actual time worked and all leave with pay shall be included in determining the pro rata accrual of sick leave credits each month provided that the employee works thirty-two \(32\) hours or more that month. Employees shall be eligible to utilize sick leave immediately upon accrual.

### Section 4

Employees who have earned sick leave credits shall be eligible for sick leave for any period of absence from employment which is due to the employee's illness, bodily injury, disability resulting from pregnancy, necessity for medical or dental care, exposure to contagious disease, attendance upon members of the employee's immediate family \(employee's parent, wife, husband, domestic partner, children, brother, sister, granddaughter, grandson, grandmother, grandfather, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, or another member of the immediate household\) where the employee's presence is required because of illness or death in the immediate family of the employee or the employee's spouse or domestic partner. The Employer has the duty to require that the employee make other arrangements within a reasonable period of time for the attendance upon children or other persons in the employee's care. Certification of an attending physician or practitioner may be required by the Agency to support the employee's claim for sick leave, if the employee is absent in excess of five \(5\) calendar work days or if the Agency has evidence that the employee is abusing sick leave privileges. The Employer may also request such certificate from an employee to determine whether the employee should be allowed to return to work where the Agency has reason to believe that the employee's return to work would be a health hazard to either the employee or to others. Any cost associated with the supplying of a certificate concerning a job-incurred injury or illness that is not covered by Workers' Compensation benefits shall be borne by the Employer.

### Section 5

Salary paid for a period of sick leave resulting from a condition incurred on the job and also covered by Workers' Compensation, shall be equal to the difference between the Workers' Compensation for lost time and the employee's regular salary rate. Therefore, prorated charges will be made against accrued sick leave. Should an employee who has exhausted earned sick leave elect to use vacation leave or compensatory time during a period in which Workers' Compensation is being received, the salary paid for such period shall be equal to the difference between the Workers' Compensation for lost time and the employee's regular salary rate. In such instances, prorated charges will be made against accrued vacation leave.

#### Staff Assaults:

An employee who is off duty and on approved Worker’s Compensation time loss because of an inmate committing a staff assault shall:

1. Continue vacation and sick leave accrual while on time loss. Accrued vacation leave shall not exceed three hundred twenty \(320\) hours. 
2. Where the employee is off work due to a serious physical injury directly inflicted by an inmate and the employee’s attending physician certifies that the employee cannot perform his/her regular duties or modified work, the DOC Director or designee, shall approve the employee to receive supplemental pay in addition to the employee’s worker’s comp benefit which shall be equal to the regular salary rate \(i.e., the step in the salary range at which the employee is paid\) for the first forty-five \(45\) days of such leave. The DOC Director or designee, at his/her discretion, may continue approving the employee to receive supplemental pay in addition to the employee’s worker’s comp benefit which shall be equal to the regular salary rate \(i.e., the step in the salary range at which the employee is paid\) for the next one hundred thirty-five \(135\) days. After the first one hundred eighty \(180\) calendar days of such time loss in any rolling twelve month period, the supplemental pay shall end and the employee shall have the option of sick leave proration use as noted under Section 6. To be approved for this supplemental pay benefit, the employee must have been acting within the course and scope of his/her assignment when assaulted. Time loss resulting from stress related disabilities shall not be eligible for this supplemental benefit. Where the time loss exceeds forty-five \(45\) calendar days, the department may require the employee be evaluated by the department’s independent medical examiner to assess the ongoing need for the time off. 
3. Upon request, the Agency will pay up to three \(3\) days of administrative paid leave for the employee following a serious physical injury inflicted by an inmate under the following conditions:  a. The employee seeks medical care within forty-eight \(48\) hours of being injured or there is a doctor’s certificate the medical treatment was a result of an injury.  b. The claim must be for a period of less than fourteen \(14\) days.  c. The employee’s attending physician certifies that the employee can not work.

### Section 6

A. If an employee's sick leave accrual should become exhausted, the employee may, before using any accrued vacation or compensatory time off, request to use such leave provided the employee submits a leave slip and has a discussion with their supervisor. The request shall not be denied without valid cause or the employee is on a current written notice for attendance problems.

B. Employees on authorized FMLA/OFLA leave may elect to use leave without pay if they are covered by short- or long-term disability insurance. Employees not electing to use short- or long-term disability insurance or employees without that coverage shall use accrued paid leave \(sick leave, vacation leave, compensatory time off\) until such accrued paid time is exhausted. Employees may elect to leave up to sixty \(60\) total hours in their sick leave and/or vacation account for use following their return to work. However, employees may not reserve accrued paid leave when on intermittent or reduced schedule leave. An employee may be approved to leave up to eighty \(80\) hours of vacation leave to cover pre-approved vacation. Upon exhausting all accrued paid leave, or leave down to sixty \(60\) hours, the employee will be placed on leave without pay until FMLA/OFLA ends. Employees will notify the Agency which paid leave will be used. Employees will be able to choose which specific accrued paid leave to use in a consecutive block of time and, once selected, the employee must exhaust that particular accrued paid leave amount before being able to use any other accrued paid leave. A “consecutive block of time” shall be either all paid leave in that account \(sick, vacation, or comp time off\) or the designation of a specified number of hours, up to sixty \(60\) hours. If the employee does not inform the Agency within seven \(7\) days of which type of accrued paid leave he/she wishes to use, the Agency shall designate the employee to use accrued sick leave consistent with state and federal law until that accrued paid leave is exhausted. Thereafter, the employee may select which accrued paid leave to use, if any. If the employee does not have accrued sick leave available, then the Agency shall be authorized to designate the use of the employee’s accrued vacation hours until these hours are exhausted.

### Section 7

Employees who have to miss work due to a death of a member of their immediate family, or their spouse's or domestic partner’s immediate family as defined in section 4 of this Article and which includes aunt, uncle, nephew and niece, shall be entitled to forty \(40\) hours per calendar year for funeral leave, without loss of pay or benefits. Thereafter, the employee's funeral leave time shall be deducted from the employee's accumulated sick time. Bereavement leave under this section shall run concurrently with OFLA when applicable. The Agency shall notify the employee when OFLA is running concurrently with bereavement leave.

### Section 8

Parental and family leave will be as provided by law. In any event, the employee may utilize all accumulated sick time for such leave, to the extent allowed by Court decision or statutes.

### Section 9 - Hardship Leave

The Agency will allow employees to make irrevocable donations of accumulated vacation leave to a co-worker who has exhausted accumulated leave while recuperating from an extended or qualified intermittent illness or injury or while attending a family member suffering from an illness or injury.

Hardship leave donations will be administered under the following stipulations and the terms of this Agreement shall be strictly enforced with no exceptions:

A. Donating employees must have completed initial trial service with the State.

B. The Agency shall not assume any tax liabilities that would otherwise accrue to the employee.

C. Use of donated leave shall be consistent with the other sections of this Article.

D. Applications for hardship leave shall be in writing and sent to the Agency’s Human Resources Section accompanied by the treating physician’s written statement certifying the illness or injury. Donated leave may be used intermittently. Such application must be no later than the month during which all paid leave is exhausted. However, in no instances will applications be accepted following an employee’s return to work.

E. Accumulated leave includes but is not limited to sick, vacation, personal and compensatory leave accruals.

F. Donations shall be credited to the recipient’s sick leave account. Donated vacation hours are converted to a dollar amount based on the donor’s regular hourly rate of pay, and credited to the recipient based on the recipient’s current regular hourly rate of pay. Donations shall be in amounts of no less than two \(2\) hours. Recipients will be allowed to keep forty \(40\) hours of donated leave for future sick leave use after they return to work. All other unused donated leave will not be deducted from the donor’s vacation account.

In non-FMLA situations, donations shall be credited at the donor’s current regular hourly rate of pay.

G. Donated hours shall be converted and credited to the recipient’s account only as needed for the period of recuperation. Any unused donated hours will not be deducted from the donor’s account.

H. \(1\) Employees on parental leave for other than a pregnancy related disability are not eligible to receive donations under this Agreement.

\(2\) Employees eligible for or receiving workers compensation time loss payments may receive donated leave if:

\(a\) The Employee meets all of the eligibility requirements outlined in Section 9 of this article to receive donated leave.

\(b\) Pursuant to Section 5 of this Article, the use of donated leave payments to the employee shall be equal to the difference between the workers compensation time loss payment for lost time and the employee’s regular salary.

\(c\) If SAIF determines the employee has been overpaid as result of receiving donated leave in excess of what has been determined in Section 5, the employee will be financially responsible for any overpayments back to SAIF. The Agency shall not have any financial liability for any overpayments the employee has received from SAIF.

\(3\) Employees eligible for or receiving disability payments may receive donated leave provided all of the following requirements are met:

\(a\) Meets the criteria to receive donated leave under Section 9 of this Article.

\(b\) The employee is solely responsible for any representations made to the insurance company/PERS and Agency.

\(c\) Any overpayments or tax consequences will be the sole responsibility of the employee. The Agency will have no liability or be required to pay for any overpayments.

\(d\) If the insurance company/PERS disallows employees receiving donated leave while receiving disability insurance payments, then this Section will be null and void.

\(e\) The Agency will not be liable for paying any monies to the employee if the disability insurance company reduces its disability payment as a result of the employee using donated leave.

I. For recipient employees on trial service, time spent by the recipient on donated hardship leave shall not count toward completion of his/her trial service period nor toward the salary eligibility date for a step pay increase. When the recipient is released to return to duty, the end of trial service date and salary eligibility date will be adjusted by the period of the donated hardship leave taken.

Rest periods will consist of two \(2\) fifteen \(15\) minute breaks away from the work area. Rest periods preferably will occur between second \(2nd\) and third \(3rd\) hours and fifth \(5th\) and sixth \(6th\) hours of the employee's shift. The parties recognize that all security staff, however, cannot be guaranteed rest breaks on a regular and recurring basis. Management agrees to make every reasonable effort to allow rest breaks for security staff where possible, but does not guarantee that rest breaks will be granted on every work shift or that they will occur at regular times or during the time frames mentioned above, nor that the break would occur away from the work area in every case.

The Institution/functional unit may revoke the schedule without an unpaid meal period upon seven \(7\) calendar days prior written notice. If the corrections professional employee revokes the schedule, the Institution/functional unit shall not suffer any overtime, shift change penalty pay or other premium pay penalties. 

D. Where there is a conflict between subsection \(b\) and \(c\) and Section 2 and 4 of this article as it pertains to meal periods, subsection \(b\) and \(c\) will prevail.

### Section 6 - Seniority

Seniority utilized in this article is based on the definitions in Article 39. 

### Section 7 - Shift and Time Off Bidding

A. Regular status employees in the Correctional Officer series may bid for shifts and days off on a schedule posted by the Employer at their institution on the basis of their classification seniority as defined in Article 39. Employees on unprotected leave without pay under Article 23 or 26 shall not be eligible to bid shifts/days off. Regular status employees in the Correctional Officer series who have requested consideration for and met the DOC rule criteria to be assigned within Special Housing Units shall be placed on the approved bidding list and allowed to bid into positions in Special Housing at OSP \(DSU, MHI, and IMU\) and to positions at OSCI in Unit 5 may bid within those work units for shifts and days off on a schedule posted by the Employer at the work unit on the basis of their classification seniority as defined in Article 39. The manner of bidding will be consistent with the method spelled out in paragraph E of this Section. 

B. Shift and time off schedule bidding shall apply to all bargaining unit work sections, except Education Services. In the case of the South Fork Forest Camp \(SFFC\), employees working at SFFC at the effective date of the agreement \(hereinafter called ‘red-lined’ employees\) will bid on the basis of their classification seniority for the time they have been assigned to SFFC. Employees transferring to SFFC after the effective date of the agreement will bid on the basis of their classification seniority below all of the ‘red-lined’ employees. Once the last ‘red-lined’ employee leaves SFFC all staff will begin to bid on the basis of their classification seniority as defined in Article 39. 

C. The new shift and time off schedules shall be assigned to the senior employee placing the bid. Ties shall be decided by drawing lots. The finalized schedules shall be posted at the work section no less than seven \(7\) days before the starting date for the new schedules. 

D. Training assignments shall be listed on each bid schedule as exempt from the bidding process. 

E. All affected employees, after placing two \(2\) successful and consecutive bids on the same shift/days off and working on such shift/days off for two \(2\) consecutive six \(6\) month periods, may remain on such shift/days off without placing any further bids unless out bid by a senior employee. Employees remaining on their shift/days off under this section without bidding will be considered to have placed a bid. 

F. Employees who are involuntarily reassigned shall retain their shift and days off. If that is not feasible, management will make reasonable attempts to maintain the employee’s shift and days off or close proximity of shift and days. The employee shall retain their previous bid vacation. 

G. If a previously bid slot becomes vacant, the vacancy will be posted and all employees can notify management of their interest within seven \(7\) days. Management will assign the most senior person who is qualified. An employee may only be granted one \(1\) reassignment under this section per shift bid. If, after a reasonable time, no employee has bid for the vacancy, then management may assign that vacancy to the least senior employee or an employee who has not bid a scheduled shift and days off. A vacant post is defined as when an employee permanently leaves or is permanently removed from the post through resignation, transfer, Special Housing Evaluation Committee removal, retirement, promotion, demotion, termination, death, or where an employee has given notice that he/she will be absent from, or has been absent from, his/her post for forty five \(45\) days or longer within the current bid cycle. Management shall post the vacancy within seven \(7\) days of receipt of the notice of the vacancy. 

If an employee returns from his/her approved absence before the projected return date, the employee will be returned to their previous assigned post and any employee that was reassigned as a result to fill the vacant post will revert back to their previously assigned post. Reassignments of this kind are not subject to the seven \(7\) day notice requirement or any penalty pay.

H. Employees will bid for a six \(6\) to twelve \(12\) month cycle to commence on or about August and February of each year. The Employer shall post notice of proposed six \(6\) to twelve \(12\) month rotation of shift and time off schedules and a seniority roster at the work unit thirty \(30\) days in advance of the bid. A list of employees selected for assignment to special housing and who are eligible to bid will also be posted within the same time frame. The Employer shall also designate for each employee a thirty \(30\) minute time slot in order of their classification seniority during which the employee will bid for their shift and days off. If an employee does not bid within the thirty \(30\) minute time slot the employee will lose the right to bid by seniority; however, the employee may submit a belated bid, which will be recognized as of the time the bid is received and shall have seniority over employees who have not yet bid for a shift and days off. An employee may bid in person, or by calling by telephone to a designated person. The employees will bid by signing on the bid document for one slot, with the shifts and days off that the employee desires. The bid shall address only shift and days off. All bids must be in writing, signed by the employee, and numbered by preference if the employee is bidding by proxy. Employees bidding by proxy will be limited to three \(3\) bids. Once a bid is placed it is irrevocable. The mechanics of the bidding procedure shall be determined by the Employer. Employees on leave in the bidding period may submit proxy bids in advance to the work section supervisor. All employees, except for those on trial service may bid. 

* I. a\) The Institution/functional unit work section manager or designee will provide the Association President or local designee notice of proposed schedule changes to start/stop times and days off before the bid. If the Institution/functional unit and Association do not resolve the proposed schedule changes, either the Employer or Association may initiate fifteen \(15\) calendar days of bargaining through a written demand to bargain which is delivered to the other party. If no agreement is reached after fifteen \(15\) calendar days, either party may initiate arbitration pursuant to the procedures outlined in the PECBA. 
* I. b\) The parties agree to waive the ninety \(90\) day period of bargaining and use of mediation under ORS 243.698 et.seq. and reduce the period of bargaining to fifteen \(15\) calendar days on the single issue of start/stop times and days off for proposed schedule changes. The Institution/functional unit will not implement the proposed schedule changes until receipt of the arbitration award or if there is an agreement reached before the award is issued.

### Section 8 - Security Consideration

The Agency agrees to make reasonable efforts to provide security for the protection of employees and their personal property in the work areas. Once the Agency deems it necessary to evacuate from any work location, the Agency must determine the location is safe before instructing the employees to return to work in that area. Employees shall not be asked or required to enter an evacuated area prior to the time the location has been determined to be safe, unless the employee's work duties require work in such circumstances.

### Section 9 - Time Trades

A. Employees shall notify the Employer if they wish to make a time trade with another employee of the same classification. Time trades shall not be unreasonably denied. Time trades may be denied where either employee is not trained for the work assignment being exchanged. The Employer shall incur no overtime penalties or liabilities as a result of time trades. The employees are individually responsible to ensure that the time trade occurs as approved. The employee who fails to complete the trade as approved shall be charged with leave without pay, unless use of other leave is approved by the employee’s supervisor. 

B. All time trades shall be completed within the current bid cycle. 

C. At SFFC, staff who fail to complete two \(2\) trades in six \(6\) months will not be allowed to make a time trade for sixty \(60\) days. Another failure to complete two \(2\) trades in six \(6\) months will result in no time trades for that staff for one hundred twenty \(120\) days. 

### Section 10 - Corrections Professionals Bidding

A. Corrections professionals employees whose classification has shift work such as nurses, shall be able to bid for shifts in the same manner as correctional officer series officers bid for their shifts.

B. The relief Food Service Coordinator shift at MCCF shall revert to its prior five \(5\) day eight \(8\) hour schedule except that vacation relief shift shall be a 7 am – 3 pm base shift. 

### Section 11 - Time Change to and from Daylight Savings to Standard Time

A. Daylight Savings to Standard Time. An employee who is eligible for overtime compensation and whose scheduled shift includes one \(1\) additional hour due to change from daylight savings to standard time shall be compensated for one \(1\) hour at the overtime rate for the additional hour.

B. Standard to Daylight Savings Time. An employee whose scheduled shift is short one \(1\) hour due to the change of time may, upon request, work the final hour of the regular shift, use vacation, comp time or other appropriate leave to cover the final hour or use approved leave without pay to cover the final hour.

## ARTICLE 30 – LAYOFF

### Section 1 - Procedure Before Layoffs

When the Agency declares that a lack of funds will necessitate a layoff, the parties will meet, if requested by either party, to consider such alternatives to layoffs as: voluntary reductions in hours, voluntary paid leaves of absence, other voluntary programs and/or temporary interruptions of employment. Such alternatives shall be subject to mutual agreement of the Parties. In the absence of such mutual agreement, the Employer may implement layoff procedures consistent with this Agreement. The parties agree that any and all discussions that take place under this Section are not bargaining, nor do they require the use of the dispute resolution procedure contained in the PECBA. 

### Section 2 - Procedure During Layoff

A. Layoff is defined as a separation from service for involuntary reasons not reflecting discredit on an employee. An employee shall be given written notice of a pending layoff at least fifteen \(15\) days before the effective date of the layoff, stating the reason for the layoff. Any employee who is given notice of layoff may file a written request to exercise an option in lieu of layoff with the Agency within seven \(7\) calendar days of receipt of notice of layoff. 

B. All part-time employees including job share, shall be laid off before any full-time employee is laid off from that classification, within the institution where the positions are being abolished. 

C. Employees shall be laid off by classification. Employees shall be laid off in inverse order of their classification seniority as defined in Article 39. If there is a multi-institution tie in seniority it shall be broken by drawing lots. The positions to be eliminated and classification\(s\) to be affected shall be identified by the Agency at the time the layoff is declared. 

D. All Association represented vacant positions the Agency intends to fill shall have zero \(0\) seniority.

E. Upon the effective date of layoff, an equivalent number of temporary appointments will be ended within the same classification in which the layoff is taking place and will be offered to laid off employees if such appointments are available. 

### Section 3 - Layoff Procedure if Institution Closure

In the event of an institution closure, the Agency shall provide all employees at the institution with notice that the facility is closing. This notice shall include the possibility of transfer, bumping, and layoffs.

Employees shall be provided a minimum of seven \(7\) calendar days to evaluate their options.

#### A. Security Staff

Seven \(7\) days after the notice of closures are provided to staff, the Agency and Association shall meet individually with Sergeants at the affected facility, in order of classification seniority, to receive the Sergeant’s election. Sergeants shall elect from the following options:

1. Voluntarily accept a layoff and be placed on the recall list; 
2. Elect to transfer to another institution where the Sergeant has greater classification seniority than another Sergeant; or

3. Bump down to any lower salary range classification in which the Sergeant would have previously accumulated classification seniority if the Sergeant has greater seniority than another employee in that lower classification.

In the event of bumping under option 3, the Sergeant may utilize his/her employment seniority as compared to the classification seniority of those employees in the lower paid classification. Any employee who bumps down to a lower salary range classification may request at that time to be paid for all accrued compensatory time at the rate it was being earned prior to the bumping in lieu of layoff.

In the event a Sergeant exercises option 2 above, the Sergeant with the least classification seniority at the receiving institution shall have the same three \(3\) options above. If that Sergeant has the least classification seniority in their classification, they shall be laid off, unless they exercise their bumping rights as explained in option 3 above.

At the conclusion of the Sergeant election process, the Agency and Association shall repeat the process with Corporals. At the conclusion of the Corporal election, the parties shall repeat the process with Officers.

#### B. Corrections Professionals staff

The above process shall be used for Corrections Professionals staff at the institution, beginning with the highest salary range classification. In the event of bumping, the employee must meet the minimum and any special qualifications of the position and be able to perform the essential functions of the position within thirty \(30\) days.

### Section 4 - Layoff Procedure if Position Elimination

In the event of position elimination\(s\) at an institution, the affected employee\(s\) shall elect from the three \(3\) options in Section 3 above. If the employee has the least classification seniority in their classification, they shall be laid off, unless they exercise their bumping rights as explained in Section 3 - A-3 above.

### Section 5 - Recall Procedure

A layoff recall list shall be maintained of employees by classification who are laid off or had to bump down within the bargaining unit. Such lists are maintained in inverse order of employment seniority. Recalls shall be from the list as vacancies occur in the classification from which employees were laid off. No new employees may be hired until all employees on the layoff list in that classification have been offered re-employment. Names should be maintained on the appropriate layoff lists.

An employee will remain eligible for recall for two \(2\) years from the effective date an employee is laid off. After two \(2\) years, an employee who wishes to remain on the recall list must notify the Agency by certified mail, return receipt requested, that they wish to remain on the recall list for an additional two \(2\) years.

### Section 6 - Involuntary Transfers

An involuntary transfer of an employee out of the bargaining unit shall be by inverse order of bargaining unit seniority in that classification, except where such transfer is for cause which is directly related to a disciplinary action initiated by the Agency. Except for a transfer for cause, such involuntary transfer shall be considered a layoff and the recall provisions shall apply to any employee so affected.

### Section 7 - Return of Classified Service

A regular employee who is appointed to a position in the unclassified or exempt service or a regular employee whose position is placed in the management, unclassified, or exempt service by statute shall after separation from the management, unclassified or exempt position, have the right to return except as provided for by this Agreement.

### Section 8 - Moving Allowances

The Agency will not be required to pay for any moves associated with transfer, bumping or return from a layoff list.
