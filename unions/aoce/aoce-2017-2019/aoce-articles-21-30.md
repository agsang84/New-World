### Section 2

Compensation for use of accrued vacation shall be at the employee's prevailing straight time rate of pay.

If an employee has a break in service and that break does not exceed two \(2\) years, he/she shall be given credit for the time worked prior to the break in service in determining accrual rate.

### Section 6

Time spent in actual State service or on military leave, educational leave, or job-incurred disability, leave without pay shall be considered as time in the State service in determining length of service for vacation accrual rate.

### Section 7

Vacation hours may accumulate to a maximum of three hundred fifty \(350\) hours of which only three hundred \(300\) hours are compensable pursuant to Section 11\(A\). Subject to other provisions of this Article, hours earned over three hundred fifty \(350\) hours will be immediately lost to the employee if the equivalent of those hours is not used prior to the month of maximum accrual.

### Section 8

Employees who work at least thirty-two \(32\) hours per month shall accrue vacation leave on a prorated basis.

C. Each institution will schedule vacation bidding at their usual time.

D. During the annual vacation bid process, employees may place bids for as many one \(1\) week blocks of time as they desire. However, employees will not be allowed to bid for vacation slots if they will not have the necessary accrued hours at the time of the requested days off. Those blocks of time requested can be in non-consecutive weeks.

E. OSP, MCCF, SFFC and OSCI will each bid separately.

F. In addition to the language in Article 21 \(Vacation Leave\) on vacation scheduling, and subject to Institution management establishing the number of vacation slots, custody employees shall select their vacation weeks on the basis of their seniority in the Agency with Sergeants, Corporals and Corrections Officers being considered as one \(1\) classification for this purpose as provided for below:

| Years of Service | Number of Weeks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| After 15 years | Unlimited |
| After 10 through 15 years | 4 |
| After 3 through 10 years | 3 |
| 0 through 3 years | 2 |

If open slots exist after the initial bid cycle, those slots will be available by staff submitting memos. Custody employees may bid for as many of the remaining vacation weeks as the employee wishes to have. The second round of bidding will occur no later than ten \(10\) working days after completion of the first round.,

G. Corrections Professionals staff shall continue to bid for their vacation based upon past practice.

H. The Employer and the Association will work cooperatively where the Employer will rearrange the vacation slots so that there is a reasonable amount of additional slots during prime vacationing time.

Section 10.

Upon reasonable notice to and approval of the Employer, employees shall be permitted to use any portion of or all of their accrued vacation credits in any segment, except:

A. That employees shall have their vacation time up to two hundred fifty \(250\) hours paid when they are separated, laid off, terminated or take educational leave without pay in excess of thirty \(30\) days;

Such requests will be responded to no less than seven \(7\) days prior to the requested time. If two \(2\) or more employees, on the same day, request the same period of time and the matter cannot be resolved by agreement of the parties concerned, the employee having the greatest length of State service shall be granted the time; however, this tie breaking seniority may be exercised only once in any calendar year. An employee may not use his/her seniority to bump an employee out of their Section 10 bid vacation under this Section.

### Section 11

Employees' vacations will start the first \(1st\) day following their regularly scheduled days off when approved by the Agency. Security employee vacation block\(s\) of time will start on Sunday.

### Section 12

A. Staff will be given a specific time and date based upon DOC seniority in which to take place a vacation bid. The “window” will be thirty \(30\) minutes in length. This list will be posted thirty \(30\) days in advance of the bidding process. If an employee does not bid in their assigned “window” they may bid anytime afterwards during this process for those remaining open slots.

B. If an employee desires to turn in a vacation slot, management will open that vacancy to rebid the vacant slot unless there is a valid cause not to do so. The bid period shall be open for seven \(7\) calendar days. The slot will be awarded based on DOC seniority in the following order: first preference goes to employees who have not previously had the opportunity to exercise their seniority to obtain a vacation slot, then to all employees who request the slot. Employees who chose not to bid will be considered to have had the opportunity to exercise their seniority to obtain a vacation slot. Employees may only exercise their seniority under this section once per vacation bid cycle. If the slot is returned less than thirty \(30\) days prior to the date of the vacation slot, this time will be utilized for single days off subject to first-come, first-served basis.

## ARTICLE 22 - SICK LEAVE WITH PAY

### Section 1

Employees shall accrue eight \(8\) hours of sick leave for each full month worked. Employees working less than a full month, but at least thirty-two \(32\) hours shall accrue sick leave on a pro rata basis.

### Section 2

Employees who have been separated from the State Service and return as regular status within one \(1\) year shall have unused sick leave credits accrued during previous employment restored.

### Section 3

Actual time worked and all leave with pay shall be included in determining the pro rata accrual of sick leave credits each month provided that the employee works thirty-two \(32\) hours or more that month. Employees shall be eligible to utilize sick leave immediately upon accrual.

### Section 4

Employees who have earned sick leave credits shall be eligible for sick leave for any period of absence from employment which is due to the employee's illness, bodily injury, disability resulting from pregnancy, necessity for medical or dental care, exposure to contagious disease, attendance upon members of the employee's immediate family \(employee's parent, wife, husband, domestic partner, children, brother, sister, granddaughter, grandson, grandmother, grandfather, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, or another member of the immediate household\) where the employee's presence is required because of illness or death in the immediate family of the employee or the employee's spouse or domestic partner. The Employer has the duty to require that the employee make other arrangements within a reasonable period of time for the attendance upon children or other persons in the employee's care. Certification of an attending physician or practitioner may be required by the Agency to support the employee's claim for sick leave, if the employee is absent in excess of five \(5\) calendar work days or if the Agency has evidence that the employee is abusing sick leave privileges. The Employer may also request such certificate from an employee to determine whether the employee should be allowed to return to work where the Agency has reason to believe that the employee's return to work would be a health hazard to either the employee or to others. Any cost associated with the supplying of a certificate concerning a job-incurred injury or illness that is not covered by Workers' Compensation benefits shall be borne by the Employer.

### Section 5

Salary paid for a period of sick leave resulting from a condition incurred on the job and also covered by Workers' Compensation, shall be equal to the difference between the Workers' Compensation for lost time and the employee's regular salary rate. Therefore, prorated charges will be made against accrued sick leave. Should an employee who has exhausted earned sick leave elect to use vacation leave or compensatory time during a period in which Workers' Compensation is being received, the salary paid for such period shall be equal to the difference between the Workers' Compensation for lost time and the employee's regular salary rate. In such instances, prorated charges will be made against accrued vacation leave.

Staff Assaults: An employee who is off duty and on approved Worker’s Compensation time loss because of an inmate committing a staff assault shall:

1. Continue vacation and sick leave accrual while on time loss. Accrued vacation leave shall not exceed three hundred twenty \(320\) hours.
2. Where the employee is off work due to a serious physical injury directly inflicted by an inmate and the employee’s attending physician certifies that the employee cannot perform his/her regular duties or modified work, the DOC Director or designee, shall approve the employee to receive supplemental pay in addition to the employee’s worker’s comp benefit which shall be equal to the regular salary rate \(i.e., the step in the salary range at which the employee is paid\) for the first forty-five \(45\) days of such leave. The DOC Director or designee, at his/her discretion, may continue approving the employee to receive supplemental pay in addition to the employee’s worker’s comp benefit which shall be equal to the regular salary rate \(i.e., the step in the salary range at which the employee is paid\) for the next one hundred thirty-five \(135\) days. After the first one hundred eighty \(180\) calendar days of such time loss in any rolling twelve month period, the supplemental pay shall end and the employee shall have the option of sick leave proration use as noted under Section 6. To be approved for this supplemental pay benefit, the employee must have been acting within the course and scope of his/her assignment when assaulted. Time loss resulting from stress related disabilities shall not be eligible for this supplemental benefit. Where the time loss exceeds forty-five \(45\) calendar days, the department may require the employee be evaluated by the department’s independent medical examiner to assess the ongoing need for the time off.
3. Upon request, the Agency will pay up to three \(3\) days of administrative paid leave for the employee following a serious physical injury inflicted by an inmate under the following conditions:

a. The employee seeks medical care within forty-eight \(48\) hours of being injured or there is a doctor’s certificate the medical treatment was a result of an injury.

b. The claim must be for a period of less than fourteen \(14\) days.

c. The employee’s attending physician certifies that the employee can not work.

### Section 6

A. If an employee's sick leave accrual should become exhausted, the employee may, before using any accrued vacation or compensatory time off, request to use such leave provided the employee submits a leave slip and has a discussion with their supervisor. The request shall not be denied without valid cause or the employee is on a current written notice for attendance problems.

B. Employees on authorized FMLA/OFLA leave may elect to use leave without pay if they are covered by short- or long-term disability insurance. Employees not electing to use short- or long-term disability insurance or employees without that coverage shall use accrued paid leave \(sick leave, vacation leave, compensatory time off\) until such accrued paid time is exhausted. Employees may elect to leave up to sixty \(60\) total hours in their sick leave and/or vacation account for use following their return to work. However, employees may not reserve accrued paid leave when on intermittent or reduced schedule leave. An employee may be approved to leave up to eighty \(80\) hours of vacation leave to cover pre-approved vacation. Upon exhausting all accrued paid leave, or leave down to sixty \(60\) hours, the employee will be placed on leave without pay until FMLA/OFLA ends. Employees will notify the Agency which paid leave will be used. Employees will be able to choose which specific accrued paid leave to use in a consecutive block of time and, once selected, the employee must exhaust that particular accrued paid leave amount before being able to use any other accrued paid leave. A “consecutive block of time” shall be either all paid leave in that account \(sick, vacation, or comp time off\) or the designation of a specified number of hours, up to sixty \(60\) hours. If the employee does not inform the Agency within seven \(7\) days of which type of accrued paid leave he/she wishes to use, the Agency shall designate the employee to use accrued sick leave consistent with state and federal law until that accrued paid leave is exhausted. Thereafter, the employee may select which accrued paid leave to use, if any. If the employee does not have accrued sick leave available, then the Agency shall be authorized to designate the use of the employee’s accrued vacation hours until these hours are exhausted.

### Section 7

Employees who have to miss work due to a death of a member of their immediate family, or their spouse's or domestic partner’s immediate family as defined in section 4 of this Article and which includes aunt, uncle, nephew and niece, shall be entitled to forty \(40\) hours per calendar year for funeral leave, without loss of pay or benefits. Thereafter, the employee's funeral leave time shall be deducted from the employee's accumulated sick time. Bereavement leave under this section shall run concurrently with OFLA when applicable. The Agency shall notify the employee when OFLA is running concurrently with bereavement leave.

### Section 8

Parental and family leave will be as provided by law. In any event, the employee may utilize all accumulated sick time for such leave, to the extent allowed by Court decision or statutes.

### Section 9 - Hardship Leave

The Agency will allow employees to make irrevocable donations of accumulated vacation leave to a co-worker who has exhausted accumulated leave while recuperating from an extended or qualified intermittent illness or injury or while attending a family member suffering from an illness or injury.

Hardship leave donations will be administered under the following stipulations and the terms of this Agreement shall be strictly enforced with no exceptions:

A. Donating employees must have completed initial trial service with the State.

B. The Agency shall not assume any tax liabilities that would otherwise accrue to the employee.

C. Use of donated leave shall be consistent with the other sections of this Article.

D. Applications for hardship leave shall be in writing and sent to the Agency’s Human Resources Section accompanied by the treating physician’s written statement certifying the illness or injury. Donated leave may be used intermittently. Such application must be no later than the month during which all paid leave is exhausted. However, in no instances will applications be accepted following an employee’s return to work.

E. Accumulated leave includes but is not limited to sick, vacation, personal and compensatory leave accruals.

F. Donations shall be credited to the recipient’s sick leave account. Donated vacation hours are converted to a dollar amount based on the donor’s regular hourly rate of pay, and credited to the recipient based on the recipient’s current regular hourly rate of pay. Donations shall be in amounts of no less than two \(2\) hours. Recipients will be allowed to keep forty \(40\) hours of donated leave for future sick leave use after they return to work. All other unused donated leave will not be deducted from the donor’s vacation account.

In non-FMLA situations, donations shall be credited at the donor’s current regular hourly rate of pay.

G. Donated hours shall be converted and credited to the recipient’s account only as needed for the period of recuperation. Any unused donated hours will not be deducted from the donor’s account.

H. \(1\) Employees on parental leave for other than a pregnancy related disability are not eligible to receive donations under this Agreement.

\(2\) Employees eligible for or receiving workers compensation time loss payments may receive donated leave if:

\(a\) The Employee meets all of the eligibility requirements outlined in Section 9 of this article to receive donated leave.

\(b\) Pursuant to Section 5 of this Article, the use of donated leave payments to the employee shall be equal to the difference between the workers compensation time loss payment for lost time and the employee’s regular salary.

\(c\) If SAIF determines the employee has been overpaid as result of receiving donated leave in excess of what has been determined in Section 5, the employee will be financially responsible for any overpayments back to SAIF. The Agency shall not have any financial liability for any overpayments the employee has received from SAIF.

\(3\) Employees eligible for or receiving disability payments may receive donated leave provided all of the following requirements are met:

\(a\) Meets the criteria to receive donated leave under Section 9 of this Article.

\(b\) The employee is solely responsible for any representations made to the insurance company/PERS and Agency.

\(c\) Any overpayments or tax consequences will be the sole responsibility of the employee. The Agency will have no liability or be required to pay for any overpayments.

\(d\) If the insurance company/PERS disallows employees receiving donated leave while receiving disability insurance payments, then this Section will be null and void.

\(e\) The Agency will not be liable for paying any monies to the employee if the disability insurance company reduces its disability payment as a result of the employee using donated leave.

I. For recipient employees on trial service, time spent by the recipient on donated hardship leave shall not count toward completion of his/her trial service period nor toward the salary eligibility date for a step pay increase. When the recipient is released to return to duty, the end of trial service date and salary eligibility date will be adjusted by the period of the donated hardship leave taken.
