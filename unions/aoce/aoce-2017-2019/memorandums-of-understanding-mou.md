# Memorandums of Understanding \(MOU\)

## Memorandum of Understanding \#1 - For Oregon State Correctional Institution \(OSCI\) 

### Re: Special Housing Units

This MOU is between the State of Oregon, acting through its Department of Administrative Services \(Employer\) on behalf of the Department of Corrections \(Agency\) and the Association of Oregon Corrections Employees \(Association\).

OSCI Correctional Officer series employees who bid shift and days off tied to Special Housing Units will be required to voluntarily sign this Memorandum which can and will be considered to meet and satisfy the Collective Bargaining Agreement \(CBA\) and Agency rule criteria in accordance to bidding into Special Housing Units at OSCI.

Employees who refuse to voluntarily sign this memorandum will forfeit their right to bid the shift and days off tied to the Special Housing Units.

Any employee who bids into Special Housing Units and signs this Memorandum is affirming that they have full understanding and foreknowledge of all Post Orders for Special Housing Units. This includes but is not limited to conditions in regards to inmates, DOC staff, and any applicable DOC Policy, Rule or any other factors that may affect Special Housing Units.

Once the employee has bid, signed this Memorandum, and is assigned to a Special Housing Unit, and the employee by their own choice voluntarily requests to be removed from their assignment in the Special Housing Unit \(which is tied to that bid shift and days off\), the employee will be assigned to shift and days off based on the needs of the institution as determined by Management. Their placement is regardless of shift or days off that were bid and/or assigned to the employee while in any Special Housing Unit assignment.

## Memorandum of Understanding \#2 - Between AOCE and the ODOC regarding OSCI Overtime

The purpose of this MOU is to identify when overtime is to be hired at OSCI, to clarify the process for hiring overtime among the AOCE security classifications, and to resolve the August 24, 2010 class action grievance filed by AOCE.

1. DOC Policy 40.2.1 Staff Deployment System is to be utilized to ensure staff scheduling is accomplished efficiently and cost effectively, and to increase productivity and security by strategically deploying staff. 
2. If overtime is necessary, it will be hired in accordance with AOCE Collective Bargaining Agreement \(CBA\) Article 12, Section 6.

The following list clarifies points from prior settlements of grievances and / or arbitrations not clearly stated in the Policy or the CBA in regards to roster management. OSCI shall follow these requirements when hiring overtime:

1. Prior to hiring overtime for the next shift, OICâ€™s should utilize any available resources already on shift. This is to include flex staff, shutdown posts, and / or pull posts. The OIC should take into consideration the operation of the facility for that day and ensure there are adequate staff to perform the necessary operations of the institution in a safe and secure manner. 
2. If a staff on the Voluntary Overtime List does not volunteer to work an overtime shift, the OIC should put out an all call to those staff on shift to volunteer to work the available overtime prior to utilizing the bucket list \(mandatory overtime\). 
3. If a staff member is contacted for overtime, he/she can elect to remain on the hiring list for future overtime opportunities on the same day. For example, if a staff member declines an overtime opportunity for 2:00 P.M., he / she can elect to remain on the list to be contacted for any 4:00 P.M., overtime opportunities that may occur. 
4. Staff may continue to sign up on the voluntary overtime list after it is printed by the OIC and continue to do so throughout the shift. However, staff signing up after the list is being utilized will not displace any assignments already made. 
5. When multiple staff are on overtime and overtime can be discontinued, the OIC will first offer to all staff on overtime to volunteer to go home. If no staff member chooses to go home, the OIC will release staff by inverse seniority. However, if staff are assigned to short duration overtime assignments, and those duties have been determined to be completed, those staff will be sent home first. 
6. If multiple staff are on mandatory overtime, staff will be released by order of mandatory. The last assigned is the first to leave.
