# Rights of Employees to be Represented

### Union Activities

* “Discrimination” and “interference” are different forms of unlawful activity with different elements. 
* “Discrimination” involves an intentional attempt to retaliate against an employee based on protected activity. “Interference” occurs when the employer, in any way, unduly impedes the ability of the union and its members to operate as an effective labor organization. Sometimes there is overlap between these two charges because an attempt to retaliate against an employee might be discrimination and might also, at the same time, interfere with the union’s efforts to represent members. 
* An interference charge is usually easier to prove because it looks at the management conduct to determine whether it might have a chilling effect on employees without any immediate consideration as to “why” management took that action. In other words, there is no requirement to prove “intent.” Intention is not controlling in determining whether statements made by management interfere with protected rights. Rather, it is the ability of a reasonable employee to perceive a statement to be threatening that makes it unlawful interference.

### **Right to Bargain Collectively**

* By statute \([**ORS 243.650**](https://github.com/agsang84/SnakePit/tree/81c447b7caf3f3aa3b2cfed6ec4e4268945f4858/laws-and-rules/ors/ors-243.650)\) and case law, they have been assigned the responsibility to represent all the employees on “exclusive” basis in their employment relationship with the employer \(whether or not they are even dues paying members of the union\). This union “exclusivity” status includes the sole right to negotiate workplace rules. In other words, employees cannot deal directly or otherwise behind the union’s back to work their issues out with the employer. 
  * Washington PERC has found most aspects of discipline and discipline procedures to be bargainable, not only including the right to arbitrate discipline and officer bill of rights, but also rules of conduct. 
  * Staffing levels and “minimum staffing” are generally not bargainable, except where there is compelling evidence of a safety hazard. On the other hand, an increase in the minimum staffing numbers that directly changes the ability of employees to take leave is negotiable. 
  * Rules and procedures concerning the assignment of specialty positions have been found bargain-able by PERC. 
  * Direct negotiations by an employer with employees are generally unlawful. If an officer is meeting with his employer to determine his working conditions and his union representative is not present, the meeting is probably unlawful. Only the union can negotiate changes in working conditions.
