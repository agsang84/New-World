# Unlawful Discrimination

### Racial Discrimination

### Sexual harassment

Sexual harassment usually arises in one of two forms:

1. “quid pro quo” harassment or
2. Hostile work environment harassment. “Quid pro quo” harassment involves the conditioning of employment opportunities and benefits for the receipt of sexual favors. Consent is not a defense. The rules concerning “quid pro quo” sexual harassment are fairly clear.

## Religious Discrimination

Religious discrimination issues occasionally arise. Employers are required to “reasonably accommodate” religious faiths. This duty to accommodate does not extend to the point where accommodation creates an “undue hardship” in the workplace. A classic example of undue hardship is a scheduling conflict. If an accommodation of the schedule directly contradicts the parties CBA, it would be considered an “undue hardship” and the religious accommodation need not be made.

## DAS – ACCOMMODATION OF RELIGIOUS PRACTICES

Under the Oregon Workplace Religious Freedom Act \(ORS 659A.033\), an employee may request time off from work to participate in religious holidays or holy days using appropriate paid leave \(vacation leave, personal business leave or compensatory time\). The agency must evaluate the request based on business need and adequate coverage and the employee’s availability of leave.

An agency is required to allow an employee to use vacation leave or other appropriate paid leave available for the purpose of allowing an employee to engage in the religious observance or practices. If the accommodation creates an undue hardship on the operation of the agency up to creating significant difficulty or expense to the agency.

The agency violates ORS 659A.030 if the agency imposes an occupational requirement that restricts the ability of an employee to wear religious clothing, or to take time off for a holy day or participate in a religious observance or practice when the employee has appropriate paid leave available.
