# Right to Free Speech

Since Connick, the courts have had to determine whether speech was primarily concerned with a matter of **\(1\) a public concern, or \(2\) a personal grievance**. Moreover, speech affecting a public concern is only protected when it does not “unduly disrupt” the workplace. Speech that occurs as part of everyday work has perplexed the courts in their years since their 1983 Connick decision, and they have yet to adopt any clear and consistently followed legal standards for whether work related speech that is critical of the employer is or is not protected.

For public employers, whistle-blower claims often overlap claims that a public employer infringed on an employee's rights to free speech. The First Amendment to the United States Constitution provides additional protection to public employees who speak out on a matter of public concern.

In order to be protected by the First Amendment, \(1\) an employee's disclosures must be made "as a citizen on a matter of public concern," not just a personal work issue, and \(2\) the agency's interest in nondisclosure must not outweigh the employee's interest in freedom of expression. Pickering v. Board of Education of Township High School District 205, 391 US 563, 88 S Ct 1731, 20 L Ed 2d 811 \(1968\).

* Statements made in accordance with a public employee's official duties are not protected by the First Amendment. Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 US 410, 410, 126 S Ct 1951, 164 L Ed 2d 689 \(2006\).
* Statements of public concern, even if made privately during work time, but not part of official duties, are protected by the First Amendment. Anthoine v. N. Cent. Counties Consortium, 605 F3d 740 \(9th Cir 2010\).
