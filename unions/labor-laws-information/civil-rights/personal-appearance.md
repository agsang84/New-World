## Right to Maintain Personal Appearance {#right-to-maintain-personal-appearance}

The courts have consistently rejected claims that uniformed public safety officers have a “liberty” or “privacy” in maintaining grooming appearance and standards of their choice. Courts have uniformly followed Kelley v. Johnson holding that the departments have the right to establish hair and grooming standards. These principles apply as well to body art and jewelry. Whether such rules are otherwise subject to the duty to collectively bargain has yet to be determined but there is at least a plausible argument that they are.
