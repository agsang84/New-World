| **Effective:** |  11/1/16 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Supersedes:** |  10/22/14 |
| **Applicability:** | All functional units |
| **Directives / Cross-Reference:** | **ORS** 468A.205;  **OAR** 330-130-0010; **DAS Policy** 107-011- 010; 107-009-0080;  **Executive Order** 06-02; |
| **Attachments:** | Strategic Energy Management \(SEM\) Policy |

## I. PURPOSE

To identify resource conservation and associated cost-saving measures in facilities; establish guidelines to promote sustainable practices for energy, water, recycling, composting, waste prevention and procurement of environmentally-preferred products; and maximize energy efficiency and conservation to meet 100 percent of new electricity growth, “net zero” buildings and reduced greenhouse gas emissions as directed by executive orders, the Governor’s 10-Year Energy Action Plan and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act \(RCRA\).

## II. POLICY

### A. The department will purchase, account for, control and utilize all property in compliance with statutes, rules and policies of the Department of Administrative Services \(DAS\).

### B. Sustainable Construction, Maintenance and Energy Conservation:

1. Meet key performance measure of a 20 percent reduction in non-renewable resources in existing buildings through construction and retrofits.   a. Review monthly utility bills \(electricity and heating fuel\) to manage energy consumption.   b. Report monthly energy consumption to the Oregon Department of Energy for compliance on the 20 percent reduction requirement. 
2. Meet guidelines of the Strategic Energy Management \(SEM\) policy attachment.

3. Identify cost-effective retrofits to meet 100 percent of new electricity growth. 
4. 2013 is the established baseline for energy consumption at each facility. 
5. Maximize incentives offered by local utilities, the Energy Trust of Oregon, Bonneville Power Administration, and the Department of Energy’s Business Energy Tax Credit for energy-efficiency improvement projects. 
6. Conduct periodic night audits as required by DAS policy 107-011-130. 
7. Reduce greenhouse gas emissions as required by ORS 468A.205. 
8. Identify and replace greenhouse gas-emitting energy resources with cleaner technologies. 
9. Institute practices that reduce waste by increasing product efficiency and effectiveness. 
10. Encourage and support emerging environmental technologies. 
11. Turn off lighting after normal operations \(office spaces\) and in unoccupied rooms, and identify safety lighting at lowest acceptable levels to ensure security and safe operations. 
12. Follow DAS policy on holiday lights and turning off computers and appliances. 
13. Identify and prioritize activities and opportunities that reduce energy use and enhance building performance.

### C. Water Conservation

1. Follow required non-essential water usage per **Executive Order 15-09** to conserve water. State agencies are to reduce water usage by 15 percent by December 31, 2020. 
2. 2014 is identified as the baseline year for water consumption and to measure 15 percent reduction goals. 
3. Repair leaks and install water-saving devices where applicable. 
4. Reduce impacts of biochemical oxygen demand \(BOD\) / total suspended solids \(TSS\) to sewer systems that allow for the conservation of water without incurring additional sewer charges. 
5. Develop a strategy for a 10 percent reduction in contaminates that result in BOD/TSS surcharges. 
6. Use native plants \(drought-tolerant\) for landscaping. 
7. Reduce the area of irrigated landscaping. 
8. Enter water usage and utility costs in the Energy Star Portfolio Manager. 
9. Per **ORS 537.099**, ensure water rights is reported to Oregon Water Resource Department by December 31 each year. The water rights fiscal year is October 1 to September 30.

### D. Recycling, Composting and Solid Waste Prevention

1. Ensure all facilities are following the agency’s recycling plan and recycling all commodities identified by January 2015. Recyclables include: cardboard, newsprint, mixed paper, batteries, e-waste, fluorescent bulbs and ballasts, all metals, printer cartridges, identified plastics \(\#1 \(PET\), \#2 \(HDPE\), 5-gallon buckets, light density polyethylene \(LPDE\) clear shrink wrap\), fabrics/textiles, shoes, pallets, ballistic vests, and others outlined in the agency Sustainability Plan.

2. Establish procedures and collection systems within each building for proper separation and disposal of recycled commodities to the Recycle Center, an established vendor \(per contract\), or as agreed upon with the facility garbage vendor. 
3. Use vendors with established contracts, the Recycle Center, or a qualified rehabilitative facility per **ORS 279.835-855**. 
4. Complete waste audits at each facility on a yearly basis if offered by garbage vendor as a free service.

5. Ensure food waste recycling and composting is addressed at institutions by June 2015. 
6. Continuously evaluate the feasibility of reducing trash dumpsters and trash compactors to lower overall refuse cost.

### E. Procurement

1. Reduce waste and impacts to the environment by strategically purchasing and focusing on environmentally-responsible products and services. 
2. Ensure products and services are cost effective, and conserve natural resources, material, and energy.

3. Purchase products that minimize environmental impacts, toxins, pollution and hazards to the greatest extent practicable. 
4. Procure electronics and appliances that are UL Listed, meet the Federal Energy Management Program \(FEMP\) and are Energy Star certified.

5. Ensure the “green” option is utilized whenever the product or service is comparable in quality, availability and price.

6. Be conscious of the recyclability and recycled content of products.   a. By 2017: Purchase 30 percent recycled content paper.   b. By 2020: 
   1.  Purchase 100 percent recycled multi-purpose paper. 
   2.  All purchased paper products must be 100 percent chlorine free. 
7. Utilize statewide contracts to encourage suppliers and contractors to offer environmentally preferable products and services at competitive prices. 
8. Encourage providers of services to consider environmental impacts of service delivery. 
9. Utilize the green purchasing list for office supplies, janitorial equipment and chemicals; items identified on the “red list” of chemicals are prohibited from purchase unless exemptions are filed with the Procurement Office. 
10. Purchase all green janitorial chemicals from the Central Distribution Center Warehouse. These janitorial chemicals are on the state-wide price agreement, and the Procurement Office will oversee compliance and mandatory reporting per **DAS policy 107-009-0080** Green Chemistry Procurement Guidelines.

## III. IMPLEMENTATION

 This policy will be adopted immediately without further modification.
