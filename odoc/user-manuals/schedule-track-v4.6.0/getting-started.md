## Business Description of Schedule Track

The Schedule Track application controls the flow of offenders & personnel through a checkpoint. Filters allow or deny access to pass through a checkpoint. Calendar events, housing, incentive levels, custody levels, history, and Volunteers are the currently available filters. Parameters may be set within each of these filters to allow or deny a person passage through a checkpoint. The person’s photo, ID number, and name are displayed upon scanning. As a person scans their ID card at a checkpoint, ScheduleTrack reads the person’s data, then applies the filters and parameters to that data, to determine whether the person should be allowed through the checkpoint or not. The program signals the operator via both audio and visual cues of success or failure validation against the security rules within each filter configured.

If successful, the person’s name and ID number are added to the associated scanner's Roster. The person is removed from the Roster on the next scan out.
