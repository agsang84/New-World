### The Right to Lawful Investigative Techniques

It is a paramount principle of “just cause” \(to be discussed in greater detail later\) that investigations be both thorough and fair. But those investigations must also be lawful. Here are some typical issues that may occur during investigations in which the lawfulness of the investigative tactics could be at issue:

[**AFSCME - CBA \(Article 47, Sec. 2 – d\)**]()  _**"Polygraphs"**_

**Work Area and Locker Searches:**

In 1987, the Supreme Court addressed the issue of a public employer searching the work area of an employee and the principles established there still mostly define this area of law. In this decision, O’Conner v. Ortega, the Court established the following principles:

1. That employees may have a “reasonable expectation of privacy” in their office space, but that a determination needs to be made on a case-by-case basis, because the actual existence of such a “reasonable expectation” depends on the totality of circumstances and the work environment; 
2. Where the employer is investigating a matter which is work related, the constitutional requirement for a warrant in inapplicable; 
3. While waiving the warrant requirement for workplace searches, the Court still restrains the employer, holding it to a “reasonable suspicion” standard.

**Body Searches:** 

Courts have recognized that strip searches and body searches are extremely intrusive, and public employees have a constitutional right in connection with such searches. The tests for determining whether such a search in the workplace is valid has generally been held to be the “reasonable suspicion” standard.
