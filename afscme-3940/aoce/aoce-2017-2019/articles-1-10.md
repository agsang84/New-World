# AOCE Articles 1 - 10

## ARTICLE 1 - SCOPE OF AGREEMENT

### Section 1

This Agreement is made and entered into by and between the State of Oregon \(hereinafter the "Employer"\), and the Association of Oregon Corrections Employees \(hereinafter the "Association"\), and is binding upon the Association and the Employer and all designated representatives of the Association and the Employer.

### Section 2

The Employer recognizes the Association as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for the employees within the certified bargaining unit. The terms and conditions of employment set forth in this Agreement shall apply to all classified positions \(except temporary positions and those positions excludable by ORS 243.650\) within the bargaining unit within the Department of Corrections which are at the Oregon State Penitentiary, the Mill Creek Correctional Facility, and the South Fork Forest Camp, and the Correctional Officers, Correctional Corporals and Correctional Sergeants at Oregon State Correctional Institution.

### Section 3

If the Employer establishes a new position which is not clearly excluded from the bargaining unit under ORS 243.650 or reclassifies an existing bargaining unit position, the Employer shall notify the Association in writing within seven \(7\) days following the action, as to whether or not it believes the classification to be within the bargaining unit. The Association must notify the Employer in writing within ten \(10\) days from receipt of the notification if it disagrees about the inclusion or exclusion of the classification in the bargaining unit or the matter becomes closed. If notice of the disagreement is received within the ten \(10\) day period, the parties shall meet within fourteen \(14\) days of the above notification to discuss the matter. If an agreement is not reached within thirty \(30\) days, the Association may submit the matter to the Employment Relations Board. Should the matter not be submitted to the Employment Relations Board within the specified thirty \(30\) day period, the matter shall be considered resolved.

### Section 4

This Contract incorporates the sole and complete agreement between the Employer and the Association resulting from negotiations held pursuant to the provisions of ORS 243.650 et. seq. and supersedes all prior labor contracts. It is acknowledged that during negotiations which resulted in this Agreement, each party had the unlimited right and opportunity to make demands and proposals with respect to any subject or matter appropriate for collective bargaining and that the understanding and agreements arrived at by the parties after the exercise of that right and opportunity are set forth in this Agreement. It shall not be modified in whole or in part except by another written instrument duly executed by the State of Oregon and the Association.

### Section 5 - Complete Agreement/Past Practices.

A. Complete Agreement. Pursuant to their statutory obligations to bargain in good faith, the Employer and the Association have met in full and free discussion concerning matters in "employment relations" as defined by ORS 243.650\(7\). This Agreement incorporates the sole and complete agreement between the Employer and the Association resulting from these negotiations. The Association agrees that the Employer has no further obligation during the term of this Agreement to bargain wages, hours or working conditions except as specified below.

B. Past Practices. The parties recognize the Employer's full right to direct the work force and to issue rules, regulations and procedures and that these rights are diminished only by the law and this Agreement, including interpretative decisions which may evolve pursuant to the proper exercise of authority given by the law or this Agreement.

The Employer is not limited, confined, or restricted by past practice, rule, custom, or regulation in making changes in policies, procedures, rules, and regulations to carry out the mission of the Department.

However, this Article shall not be interpreted to restrict the Association's right to bargain the impact of mandatory subjects of bargaining or the impact of permissive subjects of bargaining where the Employer is compelled to negotiate over the matter by state law or by law, bargain the decision. In the case of disagreement between the parties, the Employment Relations Board shall make the decision under this sub-section as to whether the Employer is compelled to negotiate under State law.

The parties recognize that the rules and policies of the department may involve both mandatory and permissive subjects of bargaining; therefore the Department will not substantively change a mandatory subject of bargaining in a rule or policy without first notifying the Association.

### Section 6 - Emergencies

During periods of bona fide emergency, provisions of this Contract regarding work assignments and scheduling, job posting, and overtime scheduling may be temporarily suspended by the Employer as required for the duration of the emergency. As soon as practicable, notification of the emergency status will be made to the Association or designee.

A. A bona fide emergency is defined as the period of time during an unexpected occurrence or set of circumstances involving a substantial threat to Employer's ability to maintain the safe custody, control and security of inmates, including natural and man-made disasters or crises necessitating immediate lock down of inmates or extraordinary increase in security measures, including but not limited to earthquakes, storms, fires, inmate riots, bomb threats, explosions, power outages, inmate epidemics, escape attempts or other serious breaches of security, substantial unexpected depletions of available staff due to military call ups or disease epidemics, and periods of similar types of unexpected occurrences or sets of circumstances, which have the actual or probable effect of seriously compromising Employer's ability to maintain safe custody, control and security of the inmate population.

B. When reasonably possible, emergency suspensions of above described contract rights will be localized to the facility or work unit directly involved in the emergency occurrence or set of circumstances.

C. This Section shall not be used by management to justify suspension of above described contract rights to meet daily operational needs in filling unexpected shift vacancies due to absences of scheduled staff which occur from time to time; or, to cover holding over staff on shift during periods of minor crisis, which are of local impact in a work unit.

## ARTICLE 2 - TERM OF AGREEMENT

### Section 1

This Agreement, and attachments hereto, unless otherwise provided for herein, shall be in full force and effect from signing of this Agreement through June 30, 2019.

### Section 2

The Association will designate its bargaining team members for contract negotiations. No more than five \(5\) of them shall be released with pay for the purposes of negotiations for a successor Agreement and no more than two \(2\) of them who work at OSCI, except that the second person will be released if it does not create an overtime liability at OSCI. Negotiations time shall include agreed-upon caucus time before and/or after the joint negotiation sessions. Also, employees may trade shifts or use vacation leave to attend negotiations, if necessary. Team members shall receive no overtime pay while serving during paid release periods for negotiations. The Association agrees to schedule negotiations so that Employer will not incur any overtime penalty for team members during negotiations.

During the negotiation process, this Agreement will remain in full force and effect unless modified by mutual agreement of the State of Oregon and the Association.

### Section 3

Either party may open negotiations for a successor Agreement by giving written notice to the other party on or about December 1, 2018. The notice shall specify contract Articles, Sections and/or topics which are desired to be negotiated. Unless otherwise agreed, the parties shall commence such negotiations on or before January 1, 2019.

## ARTICLE 3 - MANAGEMENT RIGHTS

The Association agrees that the Employer retains all inherent rights of management and hereby recognizes the sole and exclusive right of the State of Oregon, as the Employer, to operate and manage its affairs in accordance with its responsibilities to maintain efficient governmental operations. The Employer retains all rights to direct the work of its employees, including, but not limited to, the right to hire, promote, assign, transfer, demote, suspend, or discharge employees for proper cause; to schedule work; determine the processes for accomplishing work; to relieve employees from duties because of lack of work or for other legitimate reasons; to take action as necessary to carry out the missions of the State; or determine the methods, means, and personnel by which operations are to be carried on, except as modified or circumscribed by the terms of this Agreement. The retention of these rights does not preclude any employee from filing a grievance, pursuant to Article 44, Grievance and Arbitration Procedure, or seeking a review of the exercise of these rights, when it is alleged such exercise violates provisions of this agreement.



## ARTICLE 4 - ASSOCIATION SECURITY

### Section 1 - New Employees

The Employer agrees to inform all new employees hired into positions included in the bargaining unit of the Association's exclusive recognition, and shall provide all present and future employees in the bargaining unit with a copy of its Agreement, provided the parties shall share equally in the costs of preparation and distribution of the Agreement. The Employer agrees to allow duly certified Association Representatives thirty \(30\) minutes, when new employee orientation classes are held, to speak to new employees about the Association's exclusive recognition, its benefits, and services available to the membership. The purpose of this meeting will be to orient new employees as to the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement. This time will not be used for discussion of labor-management disputes.

### Section 2 - Association Access

Accredited representatives of the Association, upon proper introduction and notice, shall have reasonable access to the premises of the Employer during all working hours to conduct Association business \(with appropriate observation of the security regulations of the Employer\).

### Section 3

Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, the internal business of the Association shall be conducted by the employee during non-duty time.

All policies, procedures, and rules and all provisions of this Agreement shall be applied equitably among employees to whom they apply.

### Section 4 - Release Time

Association may select, and shall certify in writing to the Agency, employees to act as Association Representatives. Association representatives and/or grievant shall be allowed reasonable release time to investigate and resolve grievances provided that such activity does not interfere with the regular work routine with prior approval of management, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Additionally, association representatives shall be allowed reasonable release time to investigate and resolve incidents involving potential grievances or unfair labor practices, and to distribute Association informational material, provided that such activity does not interfere with the regular work routine with prior approval of management, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The investigation and discussions with management towards the resolution of employee grievances will be permitted during working hours without loss of compensation. If the permitted activities would interfere with either the Association representative's or the grievant's duties, management shall, within the next working day, arrange a mutually satisfactory time for the requested activities. Time spent in grievance activities without the proper notification and release by an appropriate supervisor involved will be considered unauthorized leave without pay for both the representative and the grievant. An employee may request and have present an Association representative at any formal discussion on disciplinary actions, or grievance proceedings, or any other matter that might adversely and substantially affect his/her future employment, pay, or chances for promotion.

Management shall provide written notification to the President of the Association or designee of a pending disciplinary action \(suspension, reduction, demotion or dismissal\) against an employee. Copies of all discipline, including written reprimands, imposed upon bargaining unit members shall be automatically supplied to the President of the Association at the time the employee is notified in writing of such discipline.

### Section 5 - Association Business Leave

#### A. Employees elected to Association 

Employees elected to Association office or otherwise selected by the Association to conduct Association business that takes them away from their employment may be granted either leave without pay, vacation leave, or paid time from the release bank, pursuant to “D” below, for a reasonable period of time, upon seven \(7\) days advance notice by the Association. The determination for granting such leave shall be made by Employer based on operational needs of the Agency. Leave will be requested through the normal Agency procedure.

#### B. Association President or the Association's Representative

Association President or the Association's Representative shall be granted leave without loss of pay or benefits to attend to any of the following:

1. Association Grievance Hearings; 
2. Responding to an employee request for a representative under circumstances indicated in Section 4 above; 
3. Any other meeting where the Association's Representative is requested by a management employee of the DOC or DAS-LRU; 
4. To investigate a potential grievance or unfair labor practice; 
5. Arbitration hearings or other administrative hearings before the Employment Relations Board or State Court directly involving the Association and the Employer, and 
6. To conduct Association meetings, which will not take more than sixteen \(16\) hours a month.

#### C. Association E-Board Leave. 

Upon written request from the AOCE Executive Board to the DOC Director, up to five \(5\) E-Board members shall be given release time from their positions for a period of time up to one \(1\) year in no less than two \(2\)-week increments for the performance of Association duties related to the collective bargaining relationship. However, if they request release time for less than their full regular schedule, such release time shall be subject to the Employer’s approval based on the operating needs of the employee’s work unit and based on the principal that Association work should be scheduled during this release time wherever possible. AOCE shall, within thirty \(30\) days of payment to the employee, reimburse the State for payment of appropriate salary, benefits, paid leave time, pension, overtime, and all other employer-related costs. AOCE shall indemnify and hold the State harmless against any and all claims, damages, suits, or other forms of liability which may arise out of any action taken or not taken by the State for the purpose of complying with this provision.

#### D. Release Time Bank.

1. Members of the bargaining unit shall be entitled to donate accrued but unused vacation time and/or personal leave time to an AOCE release time bank subject to the conditions set forth in this Article. The contributions shall be in two \(2\) or more hour increments. Contributions in fractions of hours will not be allowed. Contributions to the release time bank shall not exceed seven hundred fifty \(750\) hours during the two \(2\) year period ending June 30, 2017. Any balance remaining shall be considered as part of the seven hundred fifty \(750\) hour cap for the following biennium. 
2. Establishing the Bank. When an employee desires to make a contribution to the release time bank, the employee will complete a release time contributions form and file it with payroll staff. The payroll office will determine that the employee authorizing the release time bank contribution has the earned time prior to posting the contributed time to the release time bank. A copy of all approved release time contribution forms will be forwarded to the AOCE office by payroll. 
3. Withdrawal from the Bank. Based on the operational needs of the Agency, the Agency will permit a reasonable number of AOCE members off for the use of release time bank time. Time drawn from the release time bank shall be in four \(4\) hour increments. Only the AOCE President and Executive Vice-Presidents may authorize time withdrawal from the release time bank for the purposes of grievance processing and investigation, for conducting training of Association Representatives, preparation for and travel to management-labor meetings, preparation for collective bargaining and other official Association activities within the scope of the PECBA. The leave specified herein shall supplement the leave provided in this Article. 
4. Administration. The Agency may reduce the release time bank total accrual by two \(2\) hours at the end of each month to recover the cost of administering this bank. The end of month total accrual will be submitted to AOCE monthly.

### Section 6 - Communications

A. Employer agrees to provide and maintain six \(6\) glass enclosed bulletin boards at OSP for the Association to use to post official Association notices only. The boards shall be located in areas providing reasonable access to Association membership with at least two \(2\) being provided at or adjacent to the main entrance to the inmate security facilities in the administration building, and two \(2\) to be located within the OSP walls in segregated facilities where in past practice such boards have been utilized.

There will be two \(2\) glass enclosed bulletin boards at OSCI, one \(1\) in the staff lounge and one \(1\) in the SAR room. The Association shall keep boards neat and orderly. The Association is responsible for the contents of the boards and shall furnish locks for glass enclosed boards.

B. The Association shall be allowed the use of the internal mail system for communicating with its members. These communications will not unduly impact the operation of the mail room. If the Employer determines there is an impact, this matter will be reopened for negotiations.

C. Upon written request, the Association may be allowed the use of the facilities of the Agency for meetings when available.

D. AOCE representatives and AOCE represented employees may use the Agency’s e-mail messaging system to communicate about union business provided that all of the following conditions are met:

The Agency will notify AOCE’s President in writing; the AOCE President shall respond in writing and include the action that will be taken to enforce this agreement. If the violation continues despite these actions, the Agency will notify the AOCE in writing and include the action that will be taken to enforce this agreement. The employer may exercise its right to use progressive discipline for section 1 violations notwithstanding this section. 
9. The Association shall indemnify and save the employer harmless against any and all claims, damages, suits or other forms of liability which may arise out of any action taken or not taken by the employer for the purpose of complying with this provision.

### Section 7 - Dues Deduction

Employer agrees to deduct the monthly membership dues from the pay of those employees who individually request such deductions in writing. The amount to be deducted shall be certified to the Employer by the Treasurer of the Association, and the aggregate deductions shall be remitted monthly together with an itemized statement to the Treasurer of the Association. The Agency shall provide a monthly roster by the fifth \(5th\) business day of each month.

### Section 8 - Fair Share

The terms of this Contract have been made for all employees in the bargaining unit, not solely for members of the Association. The parties recognize that it is fair that each employee in the bargaining unit should bear a fair share of the cost incurred by the Association in meeting its responsibilities as a recognized bargaining unit representative.

Each employee not exempt under recognition of this Contract shall within thirty \(30\) days of hire, have deducted monthly from his/her pay by the State for a fair share assessment in the amount certified to the Employer by the Association. Such sum shall constitute that employee's fair and equitable contribution to the expenses of administering this Contract on his/her behalf by the Association. Such deduction shall be made only if accrued earnings are sufficient to cover the service fee after all other authorized payroll deductions have been made.

The deduction and disbursement to the Association of dues, and service fees provided herein shall be accomplished monthly by the State and payment to the Association shall be made on or before the fifteenth \(15th\) day following the date such deductions were made.

Any employee who is a member of a bona fide religious organization which teaches as a doctrine of faith that payment of Association dues is wrong may follow the procedures allowed by the State law to have the employee's in lieu of dues payment paid to a non-religious charity.

The Association shall indemnify and save the Employer harmless against any and all claims, damages, suits or other forms of liability which may arise out of any action taken or not taken by the Employer for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this Section.

Any costs incurred in compiling and photocopying these statistical reports under this Agreement shall be billed to the Association.

## ARTICLE 5 - ASSOCIATION/MANAGEMENT MEETINGS

### Section 1 - Purpose

The purpose of this Article is to promote harmonious relations between the parties.

Either the Agency Head/Functional Unit Manager or the Association President/Executive Board Member may request a meeting. Each party may designate desired representation to the extent that such absences from duty do not cause a disruption of work, create a short staff situation or require overtime coverage. Off-duty personnel participating in such meetings must do so on their own time. The actual meeting time will be established through mutual agreement. Refusal of either party to meet on a given subject does not constitute a contract violation.

### Section 2 - Scope of Authority

Meetings will be held for purpose of discussion only. The committee will not enter into a binding agreement of any sort unless reduced to writing and subsequently signed by authorized individuals. Contractual type negotiations, attempts to resolve individual grievances, or similar matters must be handled in the manner provided within the Contract and will not be proper subject matter for such meeting.

## ARTICLE 7 - SEPARABILITY OF PROVISIONS

Upon request of either party, negotiations will commence for the purpose of arriving at a mutually satisfactory replacement for such term or provision.

## ARTICLE 8

This Article has been deleted per 2013-2015 negotiations, however will be left blank to hold for future use.

## ARTICLE 9 - CONTRACTING OUT

### Section 1

The Agency may determine to contract or subcontract work provided that as to work which is presently and regularly performed by employees in the bargaining unit, the Agency agrees to notify the Association and negotiate the decision and the impact of the pending action. It is specifically understood that such negotiations are not required in \(1\) emergency situations; \(2\) where the impact is minimal \(and not mandatory\).

### Section 2

For corrections professionals short-term vacancies at the South Fork Forest Camp of an Association bargaining unit member not to exceed two \(2\) weeks, such personnel may be replaced with non-bargaining unit employees, with notice to the Association prior to the assignment.

## ARTICLE 10 - SALARY AND WAGES

### Section 1

Effective June 15, 2018 or on the first \(1st\) of the month following the date of ratification of the Agreement or on the first \(1st\) of the month following receipt of an interest arbitration award, whichever is later, increase all pay rates by one percent \(1%\).

### Section 2

Nurse Practitioners pay rates at salary range 33 shall be aligned with other Union pay rates for the same classifications within the Department of Corrections.

### Section 3 - Selective Market Adjustment

Effective January 1, 2019, increase all pay rates for the Corrections Officer, Corporal and Sergeant classifications by two percent \(2%\).

### Section 4

Current language on PERS and PERS pickup shall continue through January 31, 2019.

A. Public Employees Retirement System \(“PERS”\) Members.

For purposes of this Section 2A “employee” means an employee who is employed by the State on August 28, 2003 and who is eligible to receive benefits under ORS Chapter 238 for service with the State pursuant to Section 2 of Chapter 733, Oregon Laws 2003.

Retirement Contributions. On behalf of employees, the State will continue to “pick up” the six percent \(6%\) employee contribution, payable pursuant to law. The parties acknowledge that various challenges have been filed that contest the lawfulness, including the constitutionality, of various aspects of PERS reform legislation enacted by the 2003 Legislative Assembly, including Chapters 67 \(HB 2003\) and 68 \(HB 2004\) of Oregon Laws 2003 \(“PERS Litigation”\). Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any party’s rights, claims or defenses with respect to the PERS Litigation.

B. Oregon Public Service Retirement Plan Pension Program Members.

For purposes of this Section 2, “employee” means an employee who is employed by the State on or after August 29, 2003 and who is not eligible to receive benefits under ORS Chapter 238 for service with the State pursuant to Section 2 of Chapter 733, Oregon Laws 2003.

Contributions to Individual Account Programs. As of the date that an employee becomes a member of the Individual Account Program established by Section 29 of Chapter 733, Oregon Laws 2003, and pursuant to Section 3 of the same chapter, the State will pay an amount equal to six percent \(6%\) of the employee’s monthly salary, not to be deducted from the salary, as the employee’s contribution to the

employee’s account in that program. The employee’s contributions paid by the State under this Section 2 shall not be considered to be “salary” for the purposes of determining the amount of employee contributions required to be contributed pursuant to Section 32 of Chapter 733, Oregon Laws 2003.

C. Effect of Changes in Law \(Other than PERS Litigation\).

In the event that the State’s payment of a six percent \(6%\) employee contribution under Section 2A, or under Section 2B, as applicable, must be discontinued due to a change in law, valid ballot measure, constitutional amendment, or a final, non-appealable judgment from a court of competent jurisdiction \(other than in the PERS Litigation\), the State shall increase by six percent \(6%\) the base salary rates for each classification in the salary schedules in lieu of the six percent \(6%\) pick-up. This transition shall be done in a manner to assure continuous payment of either the six percent \(6%\) contribution or a six percent \(6%\) salary increase.

For the reasons indicated above, or by mutual agreement, if the State ceases paying the applicable six percent \(6%\) pickup and instead provides a salary increase for eligible bargaining unit employees during the term of the Agreement, and bargaining unit employees are able, under then-existing law, to make their own six percent \(6%\) contributions to their PERS account or the Individual Account Program account, as applicable, such employees’ contributions shall be treated as “pre-tax” contributions pursuant to Internal Revenue Code, Section 414\(h\)\(2\).

### Section 5

Effective February 1, 2019, compensation plan salary rates for PERS participating members shall be increased by six and ninety-five hundredth percent \(6.95%\). At that time, the Employer will begin paying the six percent \(6%\) employee contributions required under ORS 238A.330 to the PERS or IAP accounts of such members, on behalf of such members, pursuant to a reduction of those members’ compensation under ORS 238A.335\(2\)\(a\) and OAR 459-09-0200\(3\). No member will have an option to receive any part of that six percent \(6%\) contribution directly, as cash or otherwise. The intent of the parties is for the contributions described under this Section to qualify for treatment as Employer contributions under Section 414\(h\)\(2\) of the Internal Revenue Code. This provision shall not be retroactive in its application or effective prior to February 1, 2019.
