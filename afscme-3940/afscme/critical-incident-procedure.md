Ensuring that the Local Union Official is adequately prepared to offer appropriate union representation is an important first step. It will be theses Local Union Officials who gather the information needed and make further notification.

Upon the occurrence of a critical incident, the Local Union Official shall immediately notify the President of their Local, or the designee as appointed by the President of the Local.

The Local Union President, official or member involved in the incident shall immediately notify the Council 93 Attorney On-Call at 1-844-236-0150. After notifying the Council 93 Attorney On-Call, the President or their designee shall immediately respond directly to the scene or stage area, if available.

## Roles:

### **Local Union Official:** 

It is the responsibility of the Local Union Official to be the liaison/ coordinator for the incident. She/he shall ensure the needs of all Union members involved are met immediately after the incident and communicate with the Local President who will contact the Council 93 On-Call Attorney.

### Council 93 On-Call Attorney: 

The On-Call Attorney shall be ready to assist and advise the member involved in the incident, the Local Union President or designee.
